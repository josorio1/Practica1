24,-1,dontkry4me,2023-04-22 18,0,My Match for 2023 (really this pun?),"For the sake of boredom right from the start: A bit more than two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Ovid devoted three complete books to the art of love. Quite pragmatically, Ovid begins by explaining where men should go to ""hunt"" for women: in the circus, at horse races, on triumphal marches, at feasts, or on the beach. Aside from the fact that triumphal marches and gladiatorial fights are rare these days, Ovid's handbook didn't really lose its relevance until a few years ago. But then the digital revolution changed our love lives. In 2012, Tinder launched a platform that reduces the search for a sexual partner to its most basic components: visual attractiveness plus basic information about occupation and status. A boon for some, sometimes cruel, but undeniably efficient. How did potential sexual partners find each other before Tinder? Sometimes through friends, sometimes at work. But the traditional place to meet was out on the town. Let's face it, finding sexual partners is one of the main incentives for going out at night. A plan that in reality only works for a few, and if you soberly calculate the success rate, it is a rather inefficient approach for most. And an expensive one at that. You start the evening with a few drinks, get about 30 minutes of that precious window of time when you are loose but not yet slurred, until some degenerate contemporary orders the first round of shots. Anything after that is almost always a waste of time from a dating perspective. The next morning you wake up alone, ashamed and afraid to look at your bank account. Shareholders of Match Group, Tinder's parent company, have had a rough time lately. Tinder has, unsurprisingly, failed to maintain revenue compared to the second pandemic year of 2021, and competitors (such as Bumble) have challenged its market position. But is stagnant user growth really such a problem? Tinder has been a household name for years; everyone knows the platform. It should come as no surprise that user numbers can't grow indefinitely. A dating platform like Tinder naturally cannibalizes itself; ideally, two users will find each other and delete the app (at least for some time). But that shouldn't scare investors away. Every year, new cohorts reach Tinder-ready age, and at the same time, the age limit of those who get involved with dating apps like Tinder increases every year. I think Tinder can increase its profitability without increasing its user base. First, it can cut costs and make processes more efficient (as recently as February 2023, Match Group laid off 8% of its employees). In addition, paywalls are becoming more commonplace for any kind of internet service these days, and at the same time, people are becoming less reluctant to pay for such services - Tinder Gold is still cheaper than going out every weekend. It's a bit of a stretch, but the tobacco industry has become increasingly profitable in recent decades, despite declining user numbers, thanks to significant productivity and efficiency gains. Tinder is also attacking its main competitor, Bumble, with its new dating app Hinge, which has seen significant user growth (yes, Hinge also competes with Match Group's own product Tinder). I realize that I will not get much support for this DD. Especially since I did not find it necessary to summarize and evaluate detailed fundamental data here. But sometimes it is good to just follow the old KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid): Match Group owns Tinder, the iconic dating app - a social network, so to speak - that virtually everyone knows. It also owns Hinge, which could be the next big thing in the dating app market. Match Group is currently valued at $9.7 billion with a PE of 13. Meta, Facebook's parent company, is valued at $547 billion with a PE of 22. That makes Meta about 56 times more valuable than Tinder. I can't help but find that odd. Position:Long: Purchase of 100 shares of Match Group on 04/21/2023 for 31.81€ per share (total: 3181€)."

Considering the current setup, it is probable that a downtrend is about to resume. Tie it with several expert opinions we’ve been seeing about an imminent pullback and it’s a very secure play. crypto won’t go ballistic this year despite the 100% rise from the bottom, it’ll fade at some point, and this seems like the right time. Consecutive drops in BTC appear to confirm the timing, in line with the incoming market downturn. silver and gold will rally significantly this year on significant uncertainty Again, another indicator that we’re about to see an uncomfortable period in the markets. So far silver and gold rallied a lot along with the market on FED pivot expectations and uncertainty from the banking crisis, but it seems like they will decouple and launch off on their own, indicating that there will be no more positivity about FED cooperation but just a lot of uncertainty. I keep an eye on the silver pullback to potentially buy back into silver miners, but it might take a while. EV charging networks will rally I see some signs of strength as this group is at the bottom, but I will wait for the market to dive and stabilise before starting to build my positions for the second half of the year. piggybank_prophet"

41,-1,OptionsKing--CFTC,2023-04-22,57,Can anyone explain to me why markets are pricing in a pause or why anyone should be bullish?,"I'm going to list off 10 reasons to legitimately be bearish for the markets right now. If you're bullish  and are expecting the fed to pause rates, I would love to hear how and why you think this will work with sticky inflation. I think I can say this for many others here, but nobody seems to understand why it's yolo season. So here are 10 reasons to bearish:  The 10 year is still dropping while markets go up. What kind of psycho shit is that? For the record, the bond market is king. Every time we've come across a financial crisis of some kind, the bond market always pings problems and problems happen. It's like the Babe Ruth of forecasting shit breaking. Inflation is sticky. How exactly can you pause rate hikes when inflation is sticky without inflation going back up? You can't, demand will ramp up again while rates are still low and only make the problem worse. Not only is the fed not going to pause rates, but they're more likely to raise them several more times. Higher rates means more problems for banks. Less and less liquidity for anyone overleveraged in US treasury bonds which for the record, is a TON of banks. This means that banks not only lend less because of this, but because of the looming debt ceiling crisis, money going back into the economy will likely be less which means less deposits for banks. When this happens, deflation happens which is great depression kind of shit. The fed clearly outlined a recession for 2023. US projection to run out of money moved from August to June of this year. This is because the treasury saw less in taxes this year despite everything it paid the IRS to collect more. Seems like the ultra wealthy pulled off another hat trick again! Knowing how the government works, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the inflated time-line. It's probably mid-May. There is a massive credit bubble around commercial real estate. Roughly $1.5 trillion are due for repayment in 2025 and because of inflation and cultural changes around WFH, there's a good chance major banks won't see much of that back. This then furthers their liquidity crisis. If rates doesn't cause them to keel over, this absolutely will. The rapidly escalating conflict in Ukraine. This alone is becoming a massive blackhole for US tax payer dollars. Thanks to the individual who leaked the documents covering Ukraine, we now know we're losing the fight. So, not only have we pumped BILLIONS of dollars into the problem, but after this is all said and done, we may not even see that money back if ever. Does the federal government expect the middle class to pick up the tab for this too? Ha, of course they do. OPEC is cutting off supply to oil causing oil prices to go up thus making inflation worse. Demand for housing is absolutely plummeting which will likely begin effecting the means to increase supply here soon. Commercial real estate defaults are growing rapidly. I find it borderline hysterical to see the market go up when companies are seeing enormous profits still. It's as if retail and institutions can't see how this impacts inflation. Demand for money is still high which is why these companies are all profiting still. If demand is still high, there WILL BE NO PAUSE. Furthermore, rates were never meant to be low as a normal part of the economy. Rates are meant to be low when it needs to be stimulated. If rates remained low, we'd live in constant inflation. However, if the fed can't stimulate the economy without making inflation worse, how do you expect the fed to handle crisis' that disrupt the flow the economy? So please, share with us what you know. Nothing about the stock market's sentiment aligns with what I was taught in school regarding economics and finance. If you have a legitimate reason as to why the market is pricing in a pause, especially around sticky inflation and everything else mentioned above, we're all ears. I say this humbly too. I will be asking questions and really investigate how and why markets should be pricing in a pause. If you can help it, providing a source would be nice. Nobody likes a trust me bro source.  I want to know why the market is pricing in a pause despite sticky inflation plus the many other elements mentioned above that genuinely require the fed to stimulate the economy. Can't stimulate the economy when inflation is sticky or when rates are low. So, rates need to go up yet, the overall market thinks otherwise. Why?"

47,-1,yolorehab,2023-04-22,121,Market Recap 4/21/23 - The Recession is Cancelled,"Friday 4/21/23 Me this week: The Fed The Fed needs to raise more, a lot more, at this moment, right now! 2023 US tax revenue is trending down about ~30% compared to 2022, but the US deficit is expected to exceed 2 trillion this year. Here is what’s bothering me: with the US government on a spending spree, how is the Fed supposed to tighten? The Fed is on schedule to shrink their balance sheet by 60 billion per month, which is less than 1 trillion a year. However, the US government is basically injecting 2 trillion a year into the system. I don’t see how liquidity can ever go down. Just a reminder that the Fed is only expecting 1% GDP growth this year and a 4.5% unemployment rate. So far, we are tracking 2% GDP growth and a 3.5% unemployment rate. The Fed is very far from done. The Economy This week’s economic data is confusing, to say the least. We got Empire State roaring higher on Monday, then Philly Fed face-slapping bad, and conference board LEI puking yesterday. But how can you end the week without another jumping surprise from SP Global flash PMI? Today’s data showed both manufacturing (11-month high) and service (6-month high) jumped to expansion territory. New orders are at an 11-month high, job growth is solid, and prices are higher too. JPMorgan said, “The April flash PMI showed unexpected and broad-based improvement, suggesting further positive momentum in the US economy, a more sustained pace of expansion, and tighter monetary and credit conditions do not appear to be significantly slowing activity at this time.” So I was trying to find out why consumers and businesses are so resilient in a tightening environment. And look what I found: Savings, so much savings. US household savings are still sitting at a historical high. And not just a little high, but 4X high! From 1 trillion before the pandemic to close to 5 trillion today.  You mfs keeps whining about inflation but look at how much cash you are hoarding! Even though the saving rate is down from 10% before COVID to 5% now, the absolute dollar amount is still higher than before COVID! Corporate, on the other hand, has a cash position declining much faster, but still higher than before the pandemic. The interest coverage ratio (calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax by the cost of a company's debt-interest payments) is declining rapidly but still higher than before the pandemic. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is declining too, indicating that US companies are deleveraging (taking less risk). Looks like it’s going to take the Fed a lot more rate hikes for a much longer time to bring inflation down.  The Business MSFT, META, AMZN will report next week. ""With tech ownership super concentrated, results to come in these stocks are critical if this equity market is to hold. MSFT and NOW next week will be huge tests in my view. They do not have to be big beats or raises, they need to be clean and stable."" - JPM Big techs are last year's biggest losers who turned out to be this year's biggest winners. Funds are looking for stability and safety. It’s not that the market is overlooking risks, but rather that all the risks are priced into small caps. So far, 76% of $SPX companies have beaten EPS estimates to date for Q1, which is below the 5-year average of 77%, but above the 10-year average of 73%. I will do a weekly recap over the weekend, focusing on earnings and yield, and update my year-end target model. Stay tuned.  Have a nice weekend everyone"

For example, their battery technology is far superior to anything else on the market and they are constantly innovating new ways to improve upon it. Additionally, their autonomous driving technology is also very advanced and will give them a major competitive advantage in the future as self-driving cars become more prevalent. Finally, Tesla has a strong brand identity which gives them an edge over other car companies. Battery tech is not a technology moat. It is only a matter of time when others can catch up. And there are other companies that can produce superior batteries, like CATL, which is a chinese battery company that has the highest density batteries. autonomous driving is also not a technology moat. other self-driving cars will be normal in the future. many chinese EVs are already showing their self-driving tech that is similar to tesla's, and autopilot has yet to be proven to be capable of full self-driving. meta's AI research is capable of soon replicating the needed technology for self-driving, with the segment anything model."
49,-1,DaddyDersch,2023-04-21,26,Did the bears fumble or is this the temporary top (cup and handle/ Weekly Inverted Head and Shoulders)? 4-21-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Week,"This has to have been the worst day of price action I have seen all year long. This was some of the choppiest and just most untradeable charting… there was absolutely zero continuation and completely irrational moves that from a technical stand point had zero basis. Today was brutal to trade. Calendar/ Earnings  We got a big week ahead of us Earnings wise… Monday nothing too market moving besides FRC finally will report after hours… but Tuesday night starts off MSFT, and GOOG. Followed by Meta Wednesday and AMZN, Snap and INTEL Thursday night. If Netflix and Tesla set the tone its that we are in for a fairly bearish week..  For those of you who missed it this morning we got a better than expect and previous PMI… why does this matter? Well this shows once again the economy is still strong and that gives JPOW room to hike longer and more then a weaker economy.  Taking a look at next week Monday there is nothing of note along with Tuesday. Wednesday durable goods could loosely move markets but the most important data comes Thursday when we get HDP and unemployment claims. Followed by PCE and PMI Friday. SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Interestingly enough much like a earlier this week we once again established a new supply on the daily below daily close. This shows once again another imbalance. With a new supply at 412 we are left with “where are we going next?” From a daily stand point the daily IV has shifted to bearish, and price action has signaled a bearish shift also and we officially lost daily extreme momentum. This should now allow for further downside next week. Downside targets are 409.73 supply to take that out and then 409.18 demand. IF we do not bounce and reconfirm 409.18 demand (support) then our target becomes 406.61 and 405.17. However, if we were to bounce from here our first upside target is 414.22 followed by 415.36 and the allusive 417.03. SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Now as much as I did not think bears were going to be able to do it and it literally came down to the last second before close… we DID put in a new weekly supply (resistance) at 412.66 which also happens to be a weekly double top and doji. This now makes our lower price target 409.98 which we did come about 19 cents from this week. Weekly IV has also flipped bearish which signifies downside. From here if we break through 409.98 and take out that support our first target would be 385.9… Now I do not really expect us to get that low so one could be bearish until a new weekly demand is established. At that time we can start looking for potential upside targets. But for now we are bearish to neutral until a new demand (support) is established. SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION  Now I see two major patterns attempting to play out here the first would be the cup and handle I have been taking about for 2 weeks now. IF that cup and handle plays out then that assumes that 415.6 is or top of the cup. This matches up with price action from beginning of February which then gives us the handle which needs to be formed next. If the handle plays out we are looking at about a $11.6 drop from the 415.6 top which puts us around 404 before we are likely to bounce. However the second pattern potential playing out here is the M pattern on a very long weekly time frame.  I have actually been eyeing this since March. Now for this to play out this also assumes 415-420 is the top of the neck line which gives us a move down to around 380 to play out the right shoulder (if you want to call this an inverted head and shoulders)… now that’s where it’s a little debatable here as some say the head HAS to be below the shoulders (lower two targets) but I have seen this play out numerous times without the head being lower…. This could potentially be an M pattern instead of an inverted H&S though. SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION  Looking at the weekly here I struggle to find a way to see this but bearish… We have an extremely clear weekly double top off 412.5 which also is a perfect weekly rejection off the January 30th weekly candle resistance. We also last week broke through the weekly rising wedge (not picture now)… all of this should open up the downside potential on SPY.  If you remember from last week on average for almost over a year now SPY has not closed more than 4 weekly candles in a row over 407.7… This week would mark the 4th close in a row over 407.3…. if past predicts the future then we should see a weekly candle close under 407.3 minimally next week. Keep in mind that as of right now MM only have a $6.26 total move price in for next week that gives us upside of $418.46 or downside of 405.94. SPY Weekly LevelsSupply- 4010 -> 412.7Demand- 385.9Support- 409.4 -> 407.3 -> 404Resistance- 412.6 -> 417.1 FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Futures weekly continues to reject the daily 8ema here and we have yet to establish a new demand which still favors that there is downside to be had. Currently we have only one level at 4116 between 4178 and 4055 supply. The futures daily also shows bearish price action, extreme momentum broken and bearish IV which all should provide some downside. FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Futures weekly without hesitation confirmed 4173 as a new weekly double top doji supply. While we now established this new supply that also has taken out previous 4148 supply on the weekly (similar to 409.98 SPY that was not quite touched). With this lower supply now out of the way we are fairly free to see a bigger retrace where we would first target 4055. Honestly for bulls they would love to see us come all the way down to 4055 and realistically 4015 to take out all the daily and weekly supplies. Once they do that they are free to establish a new demand (support) which then could lead to not only a higher high but a sustained high. The biggest issue right now is that this market can not realistically sustain a new high because of the supplies on the daily and weekly left down below. FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION  From a daily stand point I would have to feel bullish for Monday. Why? Well we are seeing a really nice 4154 double bottom with a reversal bullish doji. This should provide an opportunity for bulls to push back over the daily 8ema Monday. However, we could still negate the doji and push lower. We are now trading between the daily 8 and 20ema which tells me if we retake the 8ema and hold it then we could be heading back to the 4198 supply however, if we do close under the daily 20ema I feel fairly confident we hit 4116 demand and possibly have a bigger flush. FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION  From a weekly stand point here we remain in the current bull channel and while SPY weekly did double top we actually have quite a different pattern here but have officially closed our 3rd weekly doji in a row. We have clearly established 4175 as key resistance and 4135 as key support. Bears ideally next week will look to close us back under 4095 which also gets us under the weekly 8ema if they have any hopes for a bigger sell off to end the month. However, is bulls can hold 4135 and potentially retake 4175 there is a bigger move up potentially brewing here. VIX  Now looking at the VIX there is a potential V bottom forming here… however, despite everything that SPY does the VIX just continues to unwind day after day. Any even marginal move up on the VIX is immediately sold off by the EOD. Currently what I am seeing is that 17.6 and 16.45 is our major levels. The VIX did close a bearish engulfing daily candle here and with Futures daily reversal (bullish) doji that very well could provide an upside move Monday. While I understand how the VIX works what I don’t understand is why it is doing what it is doing… I mean think about this… why is the VIX unwinding every day? With literally everything that is going on and that is to come in 2023 and 2024 for that matter and with earnings and fomc and cpi… no one is hedging to the downside? No one is putting on 28dte+? I just find if very odd that the VIX is just unwinding like we are in a bull market again… now I know ive already talked about the potential that the market is pricing in the rate cuts wrongly by EOY… but even without that the movement is still perplexing… Now the only real thing I can think of is that everyone is using 0dte so much that they don’t have a use for the VIX anymore which would make a lot of sense to why its just unwinding relentlessly.  Now this brings up something new… the VIX1D is apparently going live Monday. Now there apparently is already a VIX9D and this is supposedly supposed to be similar in nature that we are not actually going to be able to trade the VIX1D… Now this actually might be interesting to watch and I do play to come Monday put it somewhere onto my charts and watch it… my understanding that this will simulate exactly what the VIX does but will measure 0-1dte… we might finally be able to get a bigger look into what big money is doing with 0 dte contracts. However, the fact that 0dte SPY/ SPX contracts have become such a craze and used so aggressively by big money has caused a need to make the VIX1D truly shows just how wild this market is right now and how possibly we are seeing a huge change to the market forever. WEEKLY TRADING LOG  Today was a highly fustraing day for me… very very fustrating. I took 5 losses in a row and back checking my logs I have not taken 5 losses in a row (going day to day) since June 2022 and as far as I have back checked this is the first time in well over 1.5 years. I do not have the same extensive log I do now before 2022 as I was still working full time and didn’t track as aggressively. I was able to battle back to green at one point but broke my own rules (and was humbly reminded why) of not trading power hour and immediately gave it all back. But today was a highly fustrating day. I felt like every single thing I look to fire on a play was present and then it would immediately reverse with no warning on me. Something else I found very interesting (and is exactly why I track my trades and log them the way I do so I can analyze like this) is that my level to level trades were far less proftiable and had a far lower win rate than my scalps. Which honestly looking at today and a lot of this week comes from a total lack of continuation. Almost every single day this week after the opening 1-1.5 hours of movement price action died and would consolidate till eod… for instance today for 2 hours straight SPY closed inside of the same 33 cent range. The issue I have is one shouldn’t (in my opinion) expect market to consolidate like we have been seeing intraday and we also should not expect price action to fake out like it has been… this left me entering potential breakout trades only to find myself either getting stopped out before the move happened or buying the top of the range just before a failed breakout. Today was a very fustrating day to trade. One thing that I do have in the back of my head looking back is while I do believe moving to 1dte this week was extremly profitable and an extremely smart risk to reward move… when im playing my level to level trade (which remember is usually playing a breakout/ breakdown from a major support/ resistance) if I should use a longer dte like 3-4 to allow the play to fully develop before being stopped out. Going forward I will continue to monitor my success on these L2L vs. scalp plays. I also noticed this week in my trading log there is a significant drawdown from 1130 to 230pm in my trading logs. The biggest thing I would note from this week looking at my profits and win rates is that win rate does not equal profitability… and risk management is key to profitability. The age old question of “should I quite while ahead” was answered this week when you look at my trading log… as long as the setup fits 100% of your criteria for entering realistically there should not be a reason to stop trading as long as you remain consistent and level headed. Now one could size down and trade only profits if they wished. But in the end high probability trades are worth the risk to reward."

FRC is due to release their earnings on April 24th. That means you degenerates have less than 48 hours to get in FRC on the ground floor before earnings come out on April 24th. I posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it here, it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public (I'll post it in the comments too). I still get dozens of messages every day asking if I changed my opinion and if I've sold. No, I have not. I have not changed my stance one inch and neither have I sold a single share of FRC even though as of today I'm in the money and can walk away with a nice little profit. But I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? 🚀🚀🚀 Everything I wrote in that piece is as true today as when it was written, if not truer. Fear is in the air, blood is on the streets, and uncertainty reigns. The hedges and media friend’s attacks on FRC and regional banks have continued, though it's getting a little old by now. However, the sentiment is still unbelievably negative and fear driven. The expectation is that FRC is royalty fucked, that this thing is nanometers away from failure and total bankruptcy. That is baked into the price. But we've already seen that regional banks' numbers are fairly good. This news hasn't had time to propagate through the market just yet, but it will soon. Come April 24th, we will find out one of two things: Either FRC is as royally fucked as everyone expects, in which case everyone shrugs and says ""knew it"" (the price might still go down a bit), or FRC turns out better than expected, in which case absolute pandemonium ensures. The range for this second scenario can be ""FRC's situation a little bit better than expected"" or ""god damn this thing is actually doing really well!"" or anywhere between. Read my analysis then take a nice, careful look at the below graph and tell me which scenario you think will happen: Remember, this is a long play, so I advise against buying options.

Services equally very very strong, in fact, we're at levels not seen since last April ish 2022! New orders (ie DEMAND) at US firms increased at the sharpest rate for 11 months in April as new client wins, improved customer confidence and successful marketing strategies drove the uptick. Unfortunately price pressures have skyrocketed in April: Following back-to-back months of softening cost pressures in February and March, April data indicated a pick-up in rates of input cost and output charge inflation. Operating expenses rose at a marked and historically elevated pace that was the steepest for three months. Hikes in supplier prices were often attributed to greater incremental increases in material costs during the month. Manufacturers and service providers alike recorded sharper increases in cost burdens. Meanwhile, overall output prices rose at the fastest pace for seven months. Firms stated that more accommodative demand conditions allowed them to continue passing through higher interest rates, staff wages, utility bills and material costs to clients. On Services Inflation: Reports of further and more notable hikes in supplier prices drove up the rate of cost inflation during April. The pace of increase in operating expenses was the quickest since last November. Firms were able to partly pass this through to customers, however, as selling prices increased at a sharp and historically elevated rate."

This drop could lead to the end of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's cycle of raising interest rates.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.  I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.  The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.  Uptrending Tickers RAD   5/29/23   1C   1.25 NOK   5/19/23   4C   .25 RIVN   5/19/23   12.5C   1.15 Downtrending Tickers TSM   5/19/23   85P   1.12 DHI   5/19/23  105P   1.80 PPE   5/19/23   135P   1.80 NOG   5/19/23   32P   1.10 AXP   5/19//23    135P   1.65 MDT   5/19/23   82.5P   1.76 DFS   5/19/23   95P   .40 GE   5/19/23    95P   1.52 BSX   5/17/23   50P   .35 LVS   2//28/23    62P   1.15 LEN   5/19/23   105P    1.15 PAM   5/19/23   6OP   1.10 TOL   6/16/23   60P   1.85 ELF   5/19/23   90P   1.85 ITB   5/19/23   72P   1.10 Things to consider when finding the plays- ·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.  ·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play.

90,-1,Stengel97,2023-04-21,0,Am I Regarded?,"I’m looking to expand on my thoughts and would like some perspective on something to see if I’m living inside an echo chamber. Lately I’ve had a paradigm shift with regards to streaming platforms and their over saturation of the market. I have noticed that a good portion of platforms have begun making announcements about releasing some of their content for theatrical release(Amazon’s most recent “Air”), I would assume this is an attempt to attract new subscribers to their respective platforms. Even with the theatrical release I’m under the impression that there is only really enough room for about 3 platforms. Now even if the major players I’m the streaming market (I’m think Amazon, Netflix, and Disney) buyout all the other platforms which I don’t even know if it’s possible, won’t they have to continue with the theatrical release pathway to obtaining new subscribers, how else does someone who’s not already a subscriber find their new content? Now I’m a Canadian and I’m currently only looking at Canadian investments and company’s because of the awful exchange rate of our Monopoly money, but with this line of thinking about the streaming platforms, is it reasonable to think that Cineplex (CGX) would be a large beneficiary of this new method to attract subscribers given their massive market share of Canada? The paradigm shift was during the early and later stages of the pandemic I believed that theatres would go the way of the dodo bird. I even went to see a movie I had no interest in seeing because I believed that with the pressure on them from streamers that a complete shutdown was the final nail for them. Now we’re on the other side of all the lockdowns and streaming platforms seem to be wanting to foster a symbiotic relationship with the theatre companies,  I would imagine that this would be extremely beneficial for companies such as Cineplex. If my thinking makes sense would now be a good time to do a deep dive into all the theatre related business and determine which one or two stand to be the biggest gainers from this transition?"

They're like fortune tellers, using the past to predict the future! 🔮 Now, our magical analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that, we can calculate portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma being the stars of the show. 🌟 Once we have those, we can simulate changes in greeks at different price points. This is where the real magic happens! ✨ For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or sometimes both. It's the reaction from these price levels in the past that drives our trading signals. 📈 Now, our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which reflects the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock, and the best plays benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV. 🎯 If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious, my dear. Something has changed since these plays were generated. Remember to sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest at your discretion. Risk up to 1% of your total capital on any trades you take, or less if your conviction is lower. And keep in mind that the trades were calculated before market open, so new price movement may invalidate the original thesis. 🌪️ Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? 🐻 No, darling. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level. Are you entering all these plays? 🎭 No, my child. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn. 🚀 What about new plays on the same ticker? 🔄 The new play should replace the old play, as the old play is likely now invalid. Where are the crayons? 🖍️ Click the links above, sweetie. Have you back-tested this? 🧪 Yes, with a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error). What is the historical performance? 📚 Realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%.

95,-1,False_Secret1108,2023-04-21,95,I feel like FRC is a trap,"Reasons why I think FRC is a trap: They postponed their initial earnings. It was supposed to be this week. Generally companies don't do this for good reasons. While other regional banks have shown that their net deposit loss was rather small and that the bleeding has stopped, FRC is on the extreme end. They had to be rescued. This makes me think their net deposit loss is much greater but obviously the market has priced that in to some extent. But the question is how much. If it's greater than 40% of its deposits, then I think that's bearish. Something unique about FRC is that it has a significant wealth management business. We saw that they lost of a lot employees here. If we get insight as to how much assets have left, that can be really bad for future earnings. Nothing to do with immediate earnings, but it might get removed from the S and P index soon due to its financials. To be bullish on FRC, you would have to assume that deposits are slowly growing again and they will soon reinstate their suspended dividends. I just don't see that happening. The only thing bullish about this stock is that it has a lot of short interest. All in all, too much risks. Seems like there are safer plays with regional banks without the risks like KRE index or PACW."

100,-1,yolorehab,2023-04-21,16,"Market Recap - 4/20/23 - Things are bad, but not all bad, and the Fed is not done yet","TLDR: Things are bad, but not all bad, and certainly not bad enough for the Fed to change course. Economic indicators are flashing red, but consumers are still in good shape. Earnings, on the other hand, may face more pain down the road. Global CB tightening continues, bad for stocks.  The Fed Global tightening continues. Yesterday I mentioned we should keep an eye on global liquidity, and here is a major one. ECB accounts: a very large majority agreed with Mr. Lane’s proposal to raise the ECB’s key interest rates by 50 basis points; A number of members seeing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside over the entire horizon Fed’s Mester: Need to get rate above 5% to meet 2% inflation goal... How much higher than 5% rates will need to go, and how long will need to stay there, will depend on the economy US weekly jobless claims at 245,000 last week; est. 240,000; US Apr-8 Week Continuing Claims +61K to 1,865,000, getting close to pre-pandemic level. Again, the Fed’s target is 4.5%, and we are still far from there. The Economy Just as the market starts to cheer about the surprise beat of the Empire State Manufacturing index on Monday, here comes the face-slapping news: Philadelphia Fed Apr Business Index -31.3 Vs Mar -23.2 * 8th negative month in a row * negative last 10 of 11 * lowest since May 2020 Break down:  Forecast -25.0 to -11.7 - Business conditions were -23.2 in last month - April prices paid fell to 8.2 vs 23.5 - New orders rose to -22.7 vs -28.2 - Employment rose to -0.2 vs -10.3 - Shipments rose to -7.3 vs -25.4 - Delivery time fell to -25.0 vs -24.3 - Inventories fell to -17.9 vs -11.2 - Prices received fell to -3.3 vs 7.9 - Unfilled orders rose to -11.1 vs -21.3 - Average workweek rose to -8.4 vs -22.0 - Six-month outlook rose to -1.5 vs -8.0 - Six-month outlook for capex fell to -5.4 vs -3.8 Here is the bright side: both new orders and shipments rose, and the six-month outlook rose too; both price paid and price received fell, so good for disinflation; employment rose, unfilled orders rose, and the average workweek rose; so it's not as bad as it looks. LEI fell again in March, with the recession looming. “The U.S. LEI fell to its lowest level since November of 2020, consistent with worsening economic conditions ahead... The weaknesses among the index’s components were widespread in March and have been so over the past six months, which pushed the growth rate of the LEI deeper into negative territory... The Conference Board forecasts that ""economic weakness will intensify and spread more widely throughout the US economy over the coming months, leading to a recession starting in mid-2023.” I have mentioned multiple times in my previous posts that this indicator is a leading indicator for growth and highly correlated to stock performance. Global liquidity normally leads LEI and ISM (which again needs to be closely monitored), which were up since the beginning of the year; however, the liquidity increase turns out to be just temporary and is scheduled to decline from here due to more tightening activities from CBs. Bad for stonks. But on the bright side, the Coincident Economic Index was up again in March and has been rising over the past six months (component indicators include payroll employment, personal income less transfer payments, manufacturing trade and sales, and industrial production). So there's no recession just yet. Based on past data, when LEI was at this level, the US economy would head into a recession 100% of the time. But LEI is very heavily focused on manufacturing, and currently, service is holding pretty strong and is in fact still growing. Consumers are still spending. What recession? Amex: card member spending rose 16% on a fx-adjusted basis; travel and entertainment spending grew 39% fx-adjusted. “March was a record-setting spending month. highest we have ever had."" Amex reaffirmed guidance for the full year. + Not seeing a slowdown in the consumer segment in the US. Delinquency is expected to be below pre-pandemic levels in 2023. OMNICOM CEO: ""Prior to this call, I was talking to the CEO of Adobe. And one of the things [he was] saying is, 'I wish people would stop talking the economy down because business is great.'” Confirmation that overall consumers are still spending heavily and that the service side of the economy is still pretty strong. But not everyone is optimistic. Blackrock vice chairman Hildebrand - “I don't see a soft landing happening” “don't see any scenario where we have us interest rate cuts this year” BLACKSTONE CEO: “I think inflation is definitely cooling. It is increasingly in the rear-view mirror, and we see it in our portfolio companies,"" but the Fed will “hold rates at an elevated level for an extended period of time."" The housing market is still pretty strong. Inventory is simply too low. No one wants to sell. Mixed signals on housing: S&P 1500 Homebuilding Index (blue) has rallied sharply off low and is consistent with recent move higher in homebuilder sentiment (orange), as both confirm recent firming in housing market. However, the median U.S. home sale price fell -3.3% in March to $400,528, the largest year-over-year drop since 2012... follows February’s -1.2% drop, which was first annual decline since 2012 In last week’s post, I mentioned consumers are doing OK with higher savings and lower debt than before the pandemic. Here is another piece of evidence, APOLLO: “US households are in excellent shape. Household leverage is currently at levels last seen in the early 1980s. ""If the unemployment rate rises, consumer spending will slow down, but the starting point for US households is very strong.” That's partially why I think the Fed can and will keep rates higher for longer because consumers are doing OK, which gave the Fed the confidence to keep going. Retail sales continue to slow down, with no sign of rebounding in sight. Weekly retail sales have eased to +1.1% year/year, softest gain since February 2021 The Business Even though earnings results are extremely strong this quarter, analysts’ earnings estimates for the year keep diving lower, which also affected the SP500 year-end targets. Below is the latest from yesterday. Year/year growth rate in forward EPS for S&P 500 Tech sector has fallen to -7.7%, which is worst since 2009 Bloomberg survey of Wall Street Strategists has average S&P 500 target at 4025 (blue), down from prior average of 4050 and below yesterday’s close of 4154 (orange) TSM reported earnings this morning: Q1 revenue was down 5% yoy, but what makes it worse is the Q2 guidance drop of 13.3%.

TESLA  Well Tesla broke through some MAJOR supports here… outside of a hug recovery back over 167 tomorrow by EOD… I really like a short on Tesla with a target of 150.1 then 133.9. SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  We continue to try and work through the rebalancing on SPY daily supply/ demand right now… We had a previous Supply at 411.04 that we did indeed come down and take out today… next target is 409.73 supply followed by 409.18 demand. If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. My ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07. We are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. Something I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply… That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below… granted I don’t think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in. SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION  We for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema… this is the first step in a bearish reversal… however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. We also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. The bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema… IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2… However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. SPY Daily LevelsSupply- 409.7 -> 405.2Demand- 409.2 -> 406.6Support- 409.6 -> 409.1 -> 408Resistance- 412 -> 414.2 FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  I have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY… this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. Weekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply. FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION  We once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today. With this support being broken we will now look for the daily 8ema to turn into resistance and we will watch this new black resistance line. Target should remain the daily 20ema which will hover right around 4120 tomorrow. Futures Daily LevelsSupply- 4178 -> 4198Demand- 4116Support- 4152 -> 4118Resistance- 4173 -> 4198 VIX  I saw someone compare the VIX in 2008 to current VIX and thought I would look for myself… now past does not predict the future BUT if we analyze these two charts there is a case to be made that the previous peak on the VIX we hard in March is the peak of July 2008… and that the September VIX bottom is our current bottom… IF that is the case then the major leg down is about to start…  VIX broke through resistance today and closed a nice doji… however, failed to close over the daily 8ema once again. We will watch that key 17.1 level and 17.74 level tomorrow… a closure over the 8ema to end the week could bring a bearish move next week… DAILY TRADING LOG  I had a pretty decent day trading today.. as you can see mid day today I got really chopped up… I had saw the reversal conditions forming on the 5 and 15min chart around 1pm and I was attempting to get in on it. Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down… I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn’t feel like chasing. I was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that’s the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time…. But in the end we put in a really nice profitable day again today… As of right now (if I didn’t trade tomorrow) This is my most profitable trading week since the first week of March. I am looking forward to ending tomorrow on another good note as this has been a great week of trading."

I scrapped articles analysing the last earnings report, and asked ChatGPT to summarise key new information and how market reacted to the new release. Here are the results for this week biggest earnings.  Lockheed Martin's Q1 results exceeded analysts' expectations, leading to a record high stock surge. Revenue rose by less than 1% to over $15 billion, but the company expects revenue to decline this year due to supply chain constraints. Lockheed saw a decline of 2% in its aeronautics revenue, primarily due to a backlog of F-35 fighter jets. However, the company gained a boost in contracts related to the war in Ukraine, expected to generate $1.5 billion in sales this year and up to $6 billion by 2027. The Chinese government has banned senior executives from Lockheed and Raytheon from entering, working, or residing in China, along with imports and exports related to China. Lockheed Martin's stock rose by almost 2.5% on the day, and it is up by more than 3% year-to-date, showing that Wall Street is taking notice of the company. Investors are concerned about the China issue and the potential for decoupling from Chinese suppliers, leading to dependency on other sources. The next presidential election may focus on this issue, as both sides of the political spectrum agree that the US needs to decrease its dependence on China. Many industries, including technology, chips, and production, are dependent on China, and this issue is likely to resurface repeatedly in the near future.  Goldman Sachs (GS) reported a drop in quarterly profit year-over-year, leading to a 2% decrease in share price on April 18, 2023. While they beat earnings expectations, the company missed on top-line revenue. Despite this, the drop was not significant compared to previous months in bank stocks. In the earnings call, CEO David Solomon discussed the new deposit channel provided by the bank's recent partnership with Apple to offer savings accounts to holders of the Apple Card. The move into the deposit space is seen as an attempt to keep up with the trend of online high-yield savings accounts offering upward of 4%. The bank saw a drop of 17% to $3.93 billion in fixed income trading revenue and posted a loss of $470 million on the partial sale of its $4 billion Marcus loans portfolio. Retail banking, which has a smaller role in Goldman, saw deposits down by about 3.1% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The bank's CEO, David Solomon, said that the events of the first quarter demonstrated the resilience of Goldman Sachs and the largest financial institutions in the country.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) reported its Q1 2023 earnings with mixed results, posting 1.75 million new subscribers, well below the expected 2.3 million. The company also announced an updated timeline for its password sharing crackdown, with the United States expected to receive the update in Q2. Despite the missed subscriber numbers and the stock decline, Netflix still added at least 1 million new subscribers in the Asia-Pacific region for the past five quarters. The company also said farewell to its mail-order DVD business that has been operating for 25 years. The market reaction to the earnings release was negative, and the company's shares fell nearly 3% on Wednesday. The weaker-than-expected subscriber growth and the delay in the password-sharing crackdown contributed to the decline in stock price. Investors are skeptical about the possible benefits of password sharing crackdown and are waiting to see how the restriction will play out. They also want to see more traction and more established markets, where monetisation initiatives like advertising can drive growth. Analysts believe that it's still very early innings in building out the ad tech stack and that the paid-sharing product cycle is more skewed towards Q3 or Q4.  Tesla (TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected Q1 earnings, which weighed on other electric vehicle (EV) stocks, including GM and Rivian. The company had previously cut prices at the beginning of the year, which led to a shrinking profitability in Q1. However, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said the company will likely launch full self-drive technology this year and generate significant profits, which could offset some of the margin pressure it’s facing due to aggressive price cuts. Despite the weaker Q1 earnings, Tesla’s EVs are still completely sold out at the moment, which has helped alleviate some of the pricing pressures felt by Ford since rival Tesla started cutting prices this year.  AT&T Inc reported a slowdown in growth in postpaid phone subscribers for Q1 2023, but the number still beat estimates. Free cash flow fell short of expectations but was reaffirmed by the company's CFO. The business is still growing, and the overall industry is also seeing growth. AT&T's wireless service revenue growth for the quarter is over 5%, and the business grew profits by 8%. The market reacted negatively to the news, and AT&T shares fell after the earnings release. Although the growth in subscribers still beat estimates, the slowdown is a cause for concern. Free cash flow also fell short of expectations, but the company's CFO reaffirmed the outlook for free cash flow, stating that it would progressively get better as the year went on. The health of the consumer is relatively stable, and the delinquency patterns remain consistent with those seen in the second half of 2022. The business is relatively resilient, but the lower-income cohorts are more challenged.  Philip Morris International Inc reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, exceeding analysts' consensus of $1.34 per share for the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's revenues fell short of expectations. While Philip Morris is facing ongoing headwinds, its long-term smoke-free goals remain on track. Favorable pricing variance has been an upside for the company, although earnings declined year over year.. The markets reacted negatively to the news, with Philip Morris International falling in Thursday trading. The decline followed the announcement that the company's revenue missed expectations.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, announced a revenue slowdown in Q2 due to the weak global economy and high energy prices weighing on demand. The company’s CFO, Wendell Huang, stated that TSMC is expecting further inventory adjustments to continue impacting its business in Q2 2023, and the company forecasts a Q2 revenue of between $15.2 billion and $16 billion, down from $18.16 billion a year earlier. The chipmaker’s Q1 earnings rose and beat expectations, but it was the smallest quarterly earnings growth in almost four years. Despite the revenue forecast, TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year, and its shares rose about 4% after earlier being down. TSMC’s Q2 revenue forecast highlights the inventory glut consumers are facing, while a weakening global economy clouds the demand outlook. However, the fact that TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year despite the revenue forecast provides some optimism. TSMC is an important supplier to Apple and a bellwether for the rest of the chip industry. Despite the worse-than-expected Q2 revenue forecast, the company’s shares rose around 4%, indicating that investors have already factored in the expected slowdown."

Tax figures turned out to be lackluster, pushing the deadline significantly closer. As a result, the price of insuring against a US default has risen to levels last seen in 2012. At its peak in 2008, the figure was nearly twice as high as it is now, but the situation is still fraught. The US Treasury Secretary claims a default is impossible, yet 5-year CDS are already hovering around 50 basis points. The crux of the debt ceiling issue lies in the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Until now, the Biden administration has been unwilling to negotiate on this matter. However, it seems that this may change. We'll keep an eye on the next episodes of this ongoing political drama. The deadline is fast approaching."

134,-1,Only6Inches,2023-04-20,109,4/20 Yearly ASTS Update - Mixed bag or Future winner?,"Disclaimer: I am only posting this yearly update as a way for me to journal my thinking and for future bragging rights (or to become an eternal WSB 🤡). I am documenting my way to an 8 digit portfolio by the end of the decade. Fellow degens, Here is my yearly 4/20 update on holding $ASTS (AST SpaceMobile). Safe to say, if you had bought last year at $8 [4/20 Update 2022 -- I invite you to read it for some context] and held until now, you would be down >45%. Ouch. You would have underperformed (euphemism) both SPY and QQQ by a wide margin over the past 12 months... Ouch (twice). At least, I did. Ouch (again). However, you would have had plenty of opportunities to sell along the way at $9 in June, $14 in August and $9 in November. And this would have put you well ahead of the indices last year in a down market. It has also outperformed it's peers (deSPACs are down c.60% over the same period and space-related deSPACs have mostly become pennystocks -- a few exceptions exist). Although, I have been proven wrong so far (return-wise) and feel I jumped the gun too early. I continue to believe this is a company to follow closely. Here is why. Last year, I had identified four categories of risks: launch, technology, funding and regulatory. I was wrong. The launch didn't happen in June 2022 but was delayed to September 2022 (not the first time there is a delay with the company). However, I was right in guessing that the company had really well engineered it's deployment system and everything went out smoothly. I was right. The technology to connect the satellite directly to an unmodified phone works (CEO tweet). I am expecting a formal event in the coming months to announce it with AST's partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc.). I was right. There seems to be a huge market for the service. Mind you. Last year, nobody was talking about D2D (direct-to-device) -- it was deemed impossible by industry professionals (just like landing a rocket was deemed impossible). Now, Apple/GSAT, Starlink/TMUS, IRDM/QCOM are all working on the opportunity. Do you think a trillion dollar company and multi-billion ones would do that if there was no demand? That's a paradigm shift I didn't expect. Also, I believe AST to be a few years ahead at the very least (after the recently announced delay by Starlink and Samsung not adopting QCOM's solution). It also seems like the FCC is doing a full 180 on regulations to accomodate for this new market. Something to watch closely. I was wrong. I didn't see how shit the market would become and how difficult it would be to raise money in last year's environment. I am certain the constellation will get funded, too many stakeholders want to see it happen. Yes. I was right. Last year, AST had 17 partners under agreement and now they have 35 agreements covering more than 2bn people. At today's price, I still believe it could be a multideca-bagger and why not dream a little for a 100-bagger (it's valued at <1% of Starlink, yes Starlink, not accounting for SpaceX) by the end of the decade. On the risk-side, we now know the technology works, they are able to deploy the satellite and close the connection. Remember. This was something even industry professionals thought was impossible. Moreover, there has been no insider sales (not even the SPAC sponsor -- find me another company where that is the case). The last insider buys were at $5.5 and I am sure it's nice to buy below them (offers some comfort on the downside). The technicals seem to indicate that we have double-bottomed. There is a regulatory ruling by the FCC tomorrow (4/20). As mentioned earlier, I expect an event of some sort with AST's MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, etc.). I expect hard contracts and funding arrangements to follow or be announced at such an event. A successful test launch of Starship (highly unlikely) is a small bonus as it will signficantly lower cost of launch. I still think this is not for everyone. I believe that I shall be fine hodling long term. I know that for most of you long term is 5 hours and the only fundamental research you do is based on price action over the past week. Risk of this going to 0 is still significant and it has been a dud so far. I bought 2,000 more shares since last year. 42,000 shares (proof_1 + proof_2) TL;DR: Well, I am one year older and still full of cum. The reward is identical to last year but now with less risk as the technology has been proven. Still a potential 100 bagger by the end of the decade -- only company I know who can immediately tap 2bn customer once service becomes live. See you next year. 2021 Update 2022 Update"

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.  I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.  The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

We're about to dive into the delicious world of crayon-based technical analysis, where the colors are as vibrant as my love for karate. 🥋 This analysis is a secret recipe, combining the finest option open interest with a pinch of portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma, to be exact. It's like a beet salad for your portfolio, minus the dirt. 🥗 Once we've mixed our greeks, we can simulate their change at different price points, finding those sweet spots where portfolio-level gamma is maxed out and delta is closer to 0 than Jim is to being Assistant Regional Manager. 📊 Now, some tickers react like a Schrute at a beet auction—strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or both. These reactions are the secret sauce that drives our trading signals. The plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, as sophisticated as my Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager hat. 🎩 The best plays benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV, just like how I benefit from the absence of Jim's pranks. If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious—something changed, like the time Michael tried to cook bacon in his bed. 🥓 Adjust your position accordingly, and remember, I risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades, but if my conviction is lower, I'll allocate less and dollar cost average in. Q: Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? A: No. These trades are like a Schrute family reunion—some form of mean-reversion toward or away from an important price level. Q: Are you entering all these plays? A: No. I'm sharing these plays like I share my beet knowledge—generously. Pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn. Q: You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean? A: The new play replaces the old one, like when I replaced Jim as Assistant Regional Manager. Don't chase the price—embrace the new data. Q: Where are the crayons? I only see words. A: Click the links above, my friend. 🖍️ Q: Have you back-tested this? A: Yes, like I've tested the durability of my nunchucks. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate, with a 7% margin of error. Q: What is the historical performance? A: The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) Now, go forth and trade, like a true Schrute. Remember, fortune favors the bold, and the beet farmer. 🚜"

The Fed Fed’s Beige Book released today reporting that ""overall economic activity was little changed in recent weeks"", but most districts reported ""tighter credit conditions, declining lending activity"" and ""concerns regarding liquidity"". Overall, I don’t think there is any information that can alter Fed rate projections.  Here is the link if you are interested in some night time reading: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202304.htm The Economy Rail traffic data showed carload (commodities for industrial productions) are back up, but intermodal (containers of goods for consumers) units are still down quite a bit from last year and not much better than the pandemic bottom indicating consumer consumption is still very soft. Carload up probably from manufacturers inventory restocking (they were down in Feb yoy). But as I mentioned in yesterday’s post, shipping cost from China has been rising since the beginning of April. Definitely something to keep an eye on. Used car price fell 4% in April, first since Nov (Manheim).  But used car price is still running higher (data from cargurus.com). I assume the volume must be down but can’t find any recent data. Apparently there has been a lot going on in the auto loan business in the last 2 weeks. Remember that used car price was down in the last CPI report, so recent strength in price will definitely put pressure on CPI to the upper side. The Business I mentioned in last weekend’s post that stock performance correlates well with CB liquidity. They were up since last Oct and also after the banking crisis which supported this year's market rally. But forward liquidity is supposed to go down again as CB continues to shrink their balance sheet. I will definitely be watching closely. Netflix earning yesterday kind of provided 2 pieces of information. Consumer demand is somewhat soft (sub miss) Companies are cutting CapEx (lower production cost) I think No.2 is going to benefit stock price short term since company can use the extra cash for stock buy backs. Cost cutting from companies (I think it's going to be common in Q1) is also good for disinflation, although also means a bigger risk for recession. And TSLA did the opposite because it's still expanding rapidly. Stock was punished today for lower margin and FCF. The market thinks expanding into a recession might not be a good idea, while I personally disagree. Be bold while others are fearful, right? But obviously, there won't be much cash for stock buy backs. My positions has not changed."

172,-1,DaddyDersch,2023-04-19,43,4-19-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis (Bonus- Tesla Earnings),"Well one would have assumed after a major support line was broken and we had a -0.5%+ open… that we would see some bearish continuation… but instead just like the last almost month now it was one again a buy the dip type of day… we did end up with a decent bearish reversal EOD though. TESLA EARNINGS  Initial reaction here is barely down 1%... however, everyone knows the conference call is what matters… SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Well I had mentioned yesterday that there was a major imbalance in the markets and that I found it odd to establish a new supply which should be a resistance below current price… well today we just did a very bullish thing and we turned that 414.1 Supply into a new demand (support). Now this also becomes an issue here… Why? Well we established a new Demand… which should be a support however, that demand was established above current price action and actually is exactly where we found resistance EOD today. So this is where things get choppy and hard to really find direction and make sense of it.. we should push to the next supply which is 415.36 and 417.03… however, we could drop to previous supplies below at 411.04 and 409.73. We are for sure in chop right now. SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION  Now we break through the rising wedge that has been support for over a month now. That should in and of itself be a very bearish omen for the markets… However, we once again bounced hard off the daily 8ema. The trend has officially broken… but we continue to hold the daily 8ema… Lots of chop and no continuation. SPY Daily LevelsSupply- 409.7 -> 411 -> 415.4 -> 417Demand- 414.2 -> 409.2Support- 412.1 -> 409.1Resistance- 414.1 -> 415.6 -> 416.8 FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  This is where it is very helpful to watch futures and SPY at the same time… Futures shows a slightly different picture then SPY… what im seeing here is that yes we DID bounce hard off the daily 8ema but what we got stopped in our tracks at 4178 supply… IF we were to get a huge green day tomorrow we could potentially turn 4178 into a new demand (support) which would be extremely bullish. However, if this 4178 resistance holds right now then we start talking about a push back to 4116 demand. One other thing that happened on futures is that we did take out 4160 and 4154 supplies today. However on SPY we did not take out any previous supplies. FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION  We also broke the rising wedge and put our 4th daily doji in a row in… there does appear to be a 4198 rejection and possible carrot top forming here… With the daily 8ema still holding as support that pretty much is the last support to watch before we start the next leg down… this decent miss on Tesla COULD start the next leg down. Futures Daily LevelsSupply- 4178 -> 4198Demand- 4116Support- 4154 -> 4139Resistance- 4178 -> 4198 VIX  The VIX once again put in a new 52 week low… and not only that this current level the VIX just hit is as low as the VIX was the last time SPY was at an ATH… On paper and realistically and logically (haha) the VIX daily broke its massive falling wedge and SPY/ Futures broke its rising wedge… those two doing that together SHOULD signal a sell off on Spy is imminent… but the market has proved us to be irrational. I still overall remain bearish and still hold my 93dte 405P which are down about 16%. DAILY TRADING LOG  A pretty decent day of scalping and trading today… I got chopped up pretty good mid day when we were fighting aggressively at 413.5 for so long. Days like today become increasingly frustrating to trade and we once again held a less than $3 range all day. I have had a lot of people ask why I went back to SPX… I predominantly for anyone who has been following me for a long time traded SPX 0dte all of 2022… I killed it on scalp game… however once 0dte evertday SPY and SPX hit the markets honestly 0dte just weren’t it anymore… I know others have had the same issue but there was this detachment of SPX premiums (mostly 0dte) and actual SPY/ SPX movement… meaning often times I would enter and have a good entry and SPY WOULD move down (if I bought a put) however, my put would actually lose value… there were also other times where it seemed like we got a huge move in premiums when SPY wouldn’t even move… I got away from 0dte and when I did that I went back to SPY (mostly cause SPX was too expensive due to the VIX being so high AND spread on further out SPX are not as favorable). Well recently I have worked my way back down to 2 dte and now im back at 1dte… this means I was trading on average 10-15 contracts of SPY every trade and burning a lot of commission every day… I am temporarily using SPX now because 1. It saves on commission (only 2 contracts vs 10-15)… 2. Its 60/40 tax benefits and 3. SPX has a way of moving that if you learn it can be very favorable to option buyers. In all reality trading SPY or SPX is one and in the same… smaller accounts (those buying less than 10 contracts at a time) really would benefit from SPY and I honestly think SPY options move better and easier than SPX does… but anyone trading 10+ contracts should seriously look at SPX… just be mindful of the spreads if trading further than 0-1DTE."

Some time ago, I posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it here, it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public. In it, I explained why the time to get in on FRC is before the earnings report. It's too damn late if you wait until after 4/24.  The reason for that is because the market expects FRC to be fucked. It's priced in. Bears and shorts have taken over the media and narrative and the sentiment is wildly negative, so when the earning comes out, if it turns out FRC is fucked, well everyone already expected that so who cares. But on the other hand if it turns out that FRC is in better shape than everyone expected, the stock will shoot up as the entire country heave a huge sigh of relief. We're already seeing the start of a comeback after news from another regional bank Western Alliance isn't nearly as bad as the media made it out to be. The bears are scrambling to cover. FRC itself is up over 10% today on that news alone and the storm hasn't even hit yet. Your entire life has been one long string of fuck ups and missed or squandered opportunities. Don't let this be another one. FRC to the moon 🚀🚀🚀, trillionairekid P.S. If you haven't already, read my analysis here.

This fact alone doesn't imply an inevitable market decline. On the contrary, sentiment could change for any reason, leading to a massive short squeeze. But what about the simultaneous increase in hedge fund skepticism and the rapid drop in the VIX? In March, the correlation between hedge fund positions and the VIX rose to 0.6667. This looks ominous, and not just because of the first three digits after the decimal point. A strong direct correlation between these indicators is unusual; an inverse correlation is more common. When there is a strong inverse 12-month correlation between the VIX and hedge fund positions, the SPY typically grows by 10% or more in the following six months. However, with a strong direct correlation like we see now, historical stock returns have been negative. This chart effectively illustrates the unstable equilibrium I mentioned yesterday."

183,-1,CalmGains,2023-04-19,11,What to do for Tesla's Earnings Tonight,"Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results. These tend to move the stock big time, so the stakes are high for investors and degens like us. Options will definitely be fun to play with. In this post, we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results. Tesla Q1 2023 deliveries As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q1 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered a new record of over 422,000 electric vehicles during the first quarter of the year. Tesla also confirmed having produced 440,000 vehicles during the quarter – also a new record. Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results. Tesla Q1 2023 revenue For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $23.617 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.048 billion. Despite the new record number of deliveries, these estimates would represent a quarter-to-quarter decrease in revenue due to Tesla’s implementing large price cuts during the first quarter. Lower prices are probably a smart strategy considering higher interest rates, the potential for economic deceleration in 2023, more competition, and the new rules for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nonetheless, it would be a massive year-over-year increase from $18 billion in revenue in Q1 2022. Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/t7l4Nyj.jpg Tesla Q1 2023 earnings Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now. For Q1 2023, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $0.85 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $0.94 per share. The estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the price cuts Tesla implemented during the quarter. Analysts and investors are looking to see how badly it is going to affect Tesla’s margins and, ultimately, its profits. Unsurprisingly, Tesla achieving the Wall Street consensus would be a big drop in earnings quarter-to-quarter, and the automaker would be flat on earnings year-over-year. Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/rlj48di.png Other expectations for the TSLA shareholder’s letter and analyst call The obvious thing is the gross margin. Investors are going to be looking for that number first. They want to know by how much it dropped and how much room there is since Tesla continued to drop prices after the end of the quarter. If Tesla can stay in the mid to high teens, I think investors will be happy, but if it dips lower than that, they might have a problem. Investors will also be looking at insights from management about the pricing strategy, which seems to be changing fast. Tesla shareholders will also be looking on an update on Cybertruck production as the start of production gets closer, but knowing Tesla management, I wouldn’t expect much more than it being on track for a start of production this summer and volume production next year. Cybertruck should not have a material impact on Tesla’s revenue in 2023. I assume that amid margins going down, Tesla investors are going to want to have an update on Tesla’s self-driving program, which has helped margins in the past, but the program has been stalling for a while now. Shareholders will also be particularly interested in Tesla Energy this quarter and its potential future impact on Tesla’s financials. It has been a growing business for Tesla and with a ramp-up in Megapack production, it should be bigger in Q1, but I wouldn’t expect a massive jump in deployment until the second half of the year. We will see what Tesla has to say about that. Trading Tesla Stock: Technical Analysis Trading Tesla stock is not for the faint-hearted. Shares have produced sizable annualized volatility of 64% since inception. In plain English: as much as investing in the S&P 500 is risky, investing in TSLA has historically been nearly five times riskier! Of course, the possibility of even more intense price moves, either to the upside or downside, gets magnified around earnings day. To help figure things out, Wall Street Memes recently published a strategy for trading Tesla stock. To recap, TSLA has been struggling to break free of the 200-day moving average to the upside (see here). The good news is that selling pressure should ease each time that the stock gets denied further gains at the moving average, as the pool of sellers at that level shrinks. If or when Tesla stock overcomes the hurdle, there is the possibility that a $300 price target set by the next key resistance level would open up a huge opportunity for bulls. Getting there from current levels implies a gain potential of over 60%. Such a move may sound like wishful thinking, but keep in mind that TSLA is all about high-risk and high reward. Earnings day is important because it could present the key catalyst that confirms the viability of the bullish trade – or rejects it at once. So what to do for earnings? For all the reasons above, I think it would be reasonable to get a strangle on Tesla. For the noobies, a straddle is an options strategy where we buy both a call option and a put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is typically used if we believe the stock price will experience a significant price movement but is unsure of the direction. Grabbing the 4/21 190c and 170p doesn't seem like a bad idea. The stock will certainly move."

Predictions are April 28 or EOM for vehicle certification by regulators to begin sales. Magna is notably a more established manufacturing partner than its competitors are using. Rivian is building its own factory, which is behind schedule and over budget. Lucid is also further behind schedule with lower volume. Fisker, on the other hand, is using Magna Steyr, a well-established manufacturer with a proven track record of producing EVs. Magna also has a direct stake in the company so interests are aligned. The company is guiding for production of up to 42,400 units in 2023, which would likely put it front of the pack with Rivian, Lucid, and other EV startups in production volume. Recent reservations for Fisker's Ocean SUV grew by 3,000 over the prior quarter. Their vehicle is also expected to be EPA certified for an extremely long range, perhaps best in class, and was recently certified to have a range of 440 miles in the UK. FSR has also guided for potentially positive EBITDA this year against a gross profit margin in the range of 8% to 12%. Ocean's weekly manufacturing rate via Magna stood at around 100 cars through the first quarter of 2023. The company expects to realize a material ramp in the second quarter and is eyeing weekly production of at least 800 units to meet its production guidance. What's next is simply execution. Fisker has the reservations and its production capacity is now just ramping. Keep en eye on these guys. If they begin major ramp on April 20, achieve EPA and European regulator certification by EOM... I hold a very small speculative position."

Nancy Skinner, D- Berkeley, would require that all new electric vehicles in California are equipped with so-called ""bidirectional"" charging by 2027 (news source). Passage of SB 233, which was just heard before the Senate Energy Committee and on April 25 before the Senate Transportation Committee, could spur new nationwide standards that make two-way charging the norm, not a special feature. ""EVs are energy storage on wheels. Why waste that battery, given how few miles most people use the vehicle in any given day?"" said Skinner, whose initiative was a major focus at this week's California Climate Policy Summit in Sacramento. ""But we need to make it as easy as possible."" Electric car batteries can hold approximately 60 kilowatt hours of energy, enough to provide backup power to an average U.S. household for two to three days — or far longer, if the home's electrical use is conserved. On April 18, the draft legislation was heard in the CA State Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. The bill is likely to pass later this year after being heard by committees. Result of 4/18/23 committee vote is very promising: Now, think who makes bidirectional chargers? Who stands to gain from this?"

196,-1,Pingo6666,2023-04-19,8,I found a summary analysis of Netflix's Q1 2023 earnings call transcript. Does anyone know the actual performance of their games?,"Summary for Q1 2023 Netflix： During the Q1 2023 earnings call, Netflix's Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters discussed their recent price reduction in 116 countries, and their transition away from password sharing and onto subscriber-based accounts. They also addressed their advertising strategy, outlining their plans to develop features that support advertisers and improve the consumer experience while investing in ad tech capabilities to drive a profitable business. Netflix seems to be focused on implementing incremental changes and achieving steady growth. Netflix executives discussed the company's strategies for growth in different markets, with the film division building award-winning films that are popular with fans. The company plans to improve its films while continuing to release them on its subscription service, investing in big-budget movies and bringing them to members to stand out from competitors. The company is gradually building its advertising capabilities, recognizing it's still in the early stages and will need to crawl before it can walk or run. The gaming division has 55 released games, and another 40 are in the queue for this year, including some from internal studios. The executives are excited about the innovation possibilities of bringing strategic advertising to Netflix, in addition to expanding their entertainment offerings beyond film and television. Netflix held an earnings call for Q1 2022, where they reported being the leading streaming service in terms of engagement, revenue, and profit. They plan to continue growing by providing new entertainment options, such as games based on their IP, and expanding into new content categories, including nonfiction and international films. Netflix also aims to increase their local originals in India and grow their ad-supported tier. The company is focused on delivering quality content to improve engagement and grow its member base while aiming to generate $3.5 billion in free cash flow and increase margins. They cited recent successes with shows like ""The Queen's Gambit"" and ""Squid Game"" as evidence of their ability to provide must-watch content for global audiences. The executives did not provide long-term margin guidance, but noted that they believe the company has a long way to go in terms of margin growth. They expect to be back to around $17 billion in content spending annually by 2024. The company's live strategy will be used creatively to generate buzz around certain content. Love Is Blind didn't meet expectations due to a bug, but the company plans to learn from the experience and improve its technical capabilities. Netflix has 230 million paying members, and while there are varying levels of engagement, their overall penetration into households represents a significant pool of people that will ultimately convert into paying members. The company will continue to focus on reaching and engaging a wide range of fans, recognizing the need for differentiated content to meet the needs of each audience type. They also addressed the company's capital return plans and preparing for a potential writer strike. Overall, Netflix seems to be focused on growth through innovation, expansion into new markets, and providing quality content to their global audience to ultimately drive profitability."

198,-1,chrisBlo,2023-04-19,18,Tesla sales going forward,"A very genuine question: if Tesla cut prices every 2 months, why should anyone buy a Tesla? Just postpone and have it cheaper. And the best part is… if anyone followed this logic, prices would then need to chase the ever lowering expectations of customers and keep falling. Of course this cannot go on forever as at a minimum you will need to break-even, but this “aggressive” pricing strategy has the potential to hurt the top line, because of volumes and not because of revenues per car."

( including 1+ Bil in convertible notes) and that their growth has slowed lately to 10%ish yoy revenue growth expected in 2023. But on the other hand The PS ratio is 1.76 ... yes just 1.76 for a company with gross margins around 70%. To account for dept let's make up our own ratio and use IV/S which is 2! that's low. TDOC is the biggest player in a relatively new industry that's still in it's infancy, I believe their growth slowed down because they pulled forward a lot of revenue growth due to the pandemic, but It seems evident that growth will reaccelerate in the near future. Because they bring good value and convenience to their customers and partners. On top of that TDOC has been FCF positive for a while now, so bankruptcy doesn't pose much of a risk. At least I would assume. what do you guys think? I would like to get familiar with other people's perspective regarding this stock. whenever I look at the stock's valuation I'm borderline in disbelief. Am I missing something? (in 2022 they had a huge write off, that's a non cash expense, they acquired Livongo with mostly their stock, that later went down in price. it's a wash, they were going to lose value with acquisition or without. So I don't care much about that) (This post is written in a long term buy and hold 5 years+ growth investing mindset)"

The average SP500 stock on those years grows sales 10-20% and earnings 5-10%. The SP500 trades historically at 17-18 earnings.

Everyone said Winter is over, but a tiny hint of cold weather has sparked Natural Gas prices. Boil is an leveraged etf that is based on Natural Gas futures Natural Gas is slated to rise and unlikely to fall from this level now or ever. There a few reasons for this which are mainly close to empty Natural Gas storage in the United States. Yes, articles say there is a surplus compared to 5 year average, but all these articles have posted recently that a little bit of heat in the summer will turn this into a deficit if you include the massive exports. A lot of people don't know but Natural Gas is used in the summer by companies to cool buildings. All the articles came out at the same time from places like Natural Gas Intelligence, pointing to deficit soon. There is massive demand from EU. EU has the same issue that a hot summer would massively screw their supposed surplus since there is no more Natural Gas from Gazprom from Russia There is massive demand from China from China's reopening from lockdowns. Freeport LNG is exporting massive tons of Natural Gas. Look up twitter posts of satellite images that show vessels going out. FED's policy has failed in bringing inflation down, stagflation is likely which means massive commodity spike in prices. Have another Interest Rate hike, zero effect on Natural Gas prices. A lot of you were burned by BOIL because you didn't know when to invest. There is close to ZERO chance that natural gas will go down from here. There are twitter posts with charts to prove this and also youtubers coming out of the woodworks who called it wrong now all confirmation biasing this rise in Natural Gas. If any of you disagree, would like to see some plausible reasons. BOIL is up 3 days in a row, watch it be the best trade of this year, and dare i say decade?"

The Fed More evidence for persistent inflation and higher for longer Fed rates. FED'S Bullard: Because there hasn't been much discernible progress on inflation,  interest rates must continue to rise. Despite weaker housing starts, units under construction & completions remain high. On top of that, the backlog of projects is above pre-pandemic levels, which can continue to support residential construction employment. Wage growth is now higher than inflation.

Note car purchase is up 11% yoy which adds pressure to existing supply chain issues.

However, business models whose operational pillars rely primarily on payroll, experienced earnings down drafts. 6) Days of financial reckoning for Zombie companies. 7) China’s economy got back on track.  8) Many traditional commercial real estate strategies are now struggling as interest rates normalize. Fed outlook – one more 25 basis point interest rate increase. The Economic Re-Adjustment Phase continues. April 14th earnings transcripts from large banks (JPM, WFC, and C) provided a mixed-economic picture instead of Chicken Little themes that pander to base human instincts and maximum viewership. Active investors can benefit from either reading or listening to the above-listed earnings calls and associated documents. In addition, it is good practice for individual investors to read each quarterly earnings call transcript for stocks held. A source such as Morning Star provides secondary analysis instead of endless news. Evolving economic underpinnings warrant closer attention to forward-looking investment strategies. My financial model incorporates the dwindling COVID stimulus money that cushions market selloffs and temporarily expands PE multiples and a healing supply chain.  For those tempted by the siren's songs of margin, say No. The portfolio sold GOOG in Q1 because of revenue concerns and tax loss harvesting.

This unusual once-in-a-lifetime economic rebalancing event will stretch into 2024, if not further. The early signs of this re-adjustment surfaced in the Summer of 2022 when tech companies started downsizing their R&D tech budgets, followed by the Manufacturing PMI index crossing into contraction territory in November 2022. My multi-faceted and cross-linked investment math formulas, which calculate degrees of Risk-On or Risk-Off for growth and value opportunities, indicate mild Risk On despite distorted rhetoric-themed news on media outlets such as Fox, CNN, and various radio talk shows, which resemble exercises in sophistry. Distorted news and endless interviews between quarters can lead to subconscious absorption of corrupted information while entertaining can lead to opportunity avoidance, dogmatic blame, and excuses for losses.  Most information between quarter releases is noise. I play to win, which is only possible with clean, unbiased raw data. (S&P 500 Index advanced 3.3% since the January 23rd Tea Leaf Report)"
214,-1,DaddyDersch,2023-04-18,68,"4-18-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis (NFLX earnings and BONUS Tesla Earnings Preview and TA)","Despite an impressive nearly $3 intraday drop and a straight drop for the first hour of the day… we once again found ourselves in a downtrend that consolidated before an EOD breakout… I will say today felt different though.. but still was in the end a “bullish” day. Actually the fact that we are closing today green (granted barely green) but had that morning sell off doesn’t feel right. Today intraday felt far more bearish than the day actually closed.  I did NOT play a position on Netflix (I have a pretty hard set rule NOT to trade earnings…) but I would have eyed some 310 puts on Netflix… as of right now that would have paid out impressively well.. See how this holds in the morning. Netflix has a way in my opinion of shaping the future of earnings for tech… Next up is Tesla tomorrow…  Tesla is expecting a 6.4% move per IV for tomorrow and actually interestingly enough their EPS is predicted to be fairly low compared to the last few earnings only predicting us to be 0.85. I still do not recommend any earnings plays but I am putting out the information for others. BONUS TESLA  I don’t usually include tesla but including it today for a freebie as many have requested it return… its not staying but since earnings are tomorrow lets talk about it… Weekly wise we have been holding this red channel of 166.94 to 208 since the week of January 23rd and we have now formed a massive breakout/ breakdown triangle… one could actually infer that this triangle is a massive bear flag too… Now if we see Tesla break below 181.3 by EOW then we are breaking that support and I would see that as a fairly tempting short play and honestly a closure under 166.94 would be further confirmation of downside… I would start to target 150.1 and 133.26. However, IF earnings come in good and we get an upside pump then key resistance is 203.08 followed by confirmation at 208 EOW. For me I actually would be fairly tempted to play a 30-60dte call or put in the direction of Tesla post earnings… SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Interesting day today… we FINALLY got a new supply put in. With a new supply put in at 414.1 (just below previous 414.13 supply) we now start to target 411.04 and 409.73 supplies. However, this is where we are once again in a weird pattern here.. we established a new supply which should generally be seen a resistance… however the way today opened and moved actually put the supply in lower than todays close which actually makes this a support area to watch… This is where things get complicated and we have to be careful… While a new supply means we look to retest lower supplies and target previous demand (support) which currently is 411.04 -> 409.73 and 409.18… when market is imbalanced like this we could actually bounce form here and attempt to immediately turn this 414.13 supply into a demand (support) which would be extremely bullish… Turning a supply into demand or a demand into supply is an extremely strong move. Spy is still in extreme bull momentum and the daily chart still is setting up for reversal conditions… however they are not quite perfect just yet…. Daily 8ema should still attempt to hold as support… if and when we lose that daily 8ema is when it will be time to look out below… SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION  The price action here on spy daily actually perfectly held the resistance line of that red rising wedge at 415.7 however, once again we had a bigger bounce off the low with no bearish continuation and that led to this lower end wick… The rising wedge continues to come to a tighter point here which very well could come to an end tomorrow… generally speaking rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns and when formed with this cup and handle potentially here on the daily… we are looking at a hard top with a bigger drop possible… Key support is 413.9 tomorrow and resistance at 415.9. SPY Daily LevelsSupply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417Demand- 409.2Support- 414.1 -> 412.4 -> 409.6Resistance- 415.6 -> 416.9 -> 419.6 FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  Today we also saw a new supply put in on futures daily at 4178… this is a major level to watch as this is a resistance level that dates back to February. Now with this new supply here and being that futures is far more balanced than SPY daily (another reason I like watching both) this shows that we could easily see a retest of 4160 and possible 4154 support (previous supplies) tomorrow or later this week. Our target here should be previous demand at 4116 if we can break through those 4160/4154 levels. FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION  Like I mentioned 4178 is a major level and you can see yesterdays rejection there was a major rejection for the 3rd time (With a candle body). Now interestingly enough we did pump over night and touched 4198 and nearly perfectly rejected it… not only that but we now have formed a rising wedge inside of the rising wedge. Currently blue rising wedge support sits at 4160 for tomorrow (which is a supply level) and resistance sits at 4200 and then 4218. The one thing that is clear as we have tested this 414+ area and 4160+ area is that we have come into some heavy resistance. Futures Daily LevelsSupply- 4154 -> 4160 -> 4178 -> 4198Demand- 4116Support- 4152 -> 4139Resistance- 4200 -> 4236 VIX  I continue to remain impressed that the VIX goes lower and lower… The VIX, formally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, measures how much volatility professional investors think the S&P 500 index will experience over the next 30 days. Market professionals refer to this as “implied volatility”—implied because the VIX tracks the options market, where traders make bets about the future performance of different securities and market indices, such as the S&P 500. Above is a reminder of exactly what the VIX is… now lets talk about this for a second…  Over 40% of all S&P-related options are now same day expiry (Source: Optionmetrics), or “zero-day-to-expiry” options, shorthanded as “0DTE”. Ten years ago this number was about 5-10%. The daily volume of 0DTE contracts on the S&P 500 (SPX) increased from around 400,000 in January 2022 to approximately 1.2 million in March 2023, representing a three-fold increase in daily volume, according to data from OptionMetrics.  What does this mean and why does it matter? Well this is just my opinion and gonna be a bit of a tin foil hat/ rant moment… We are starting to see days where the VIX is red (dropping) and Spy is red… and we are also seeing a lot of times now where SPY is going on a sell off only to see a huge EOD recovery… What is causing this and why are we getting tiny movement and no continuation? My opinion here is that we are seeing a few things happening… with this massive spike of 0dte options big money is playing options intraday and they are getting their instant hit and then through the rest of the day taking that OI off the boards and often times causing huge recoveries when they do so… Why are we not seeing continuation? Well the underlying VIX is not rising… why? Well no one is going short with long DTE… everyone is trading 0dte or similar net short positions… there is no more of these longer DTE contracts that take a week or two to play out… but according to many articles and analysts… big money is the most net short since 2011 and 2018 (depends on the article)… but how could the VIX be in the 16s which by all means is a bull market level? Well this is my thoughts… Markets are pretty much being set up to get slaughtered here soon. Why? Well what is happening is that markets once again do not believe jpow… they believe we are getting 100bps of rate cuts by EOY… but that’s not going to happen (as of now according to JPOW)… markets are “forward looking” but there is a lot to be said that they are too forward looking right now… plus we know historically its time to sell the last rate hike… Now if that was last meeting (if jpow changes his tune) but most likely that will be this May 3rd meeting… IF that is the last rate hike (if JPOW hard hints at this) then we are likely seeing a top on SPY and we are going to start to see some heavy downside… Now much like a month ago in march when we had the Bank run… we had huge spikes in the VIX… why? Well markets FINALLY thought there was a reason to not only sell… but to continue to sell as they thought we were apart of the next great financial crisis (we may still be)… however, quickly the VIX would dump… why? Well markets no longer believed that was the case which has led to this rally… Honestly we are in for some pretty serious pain for the next 2 weeks unless earnings severely tank the markets. Now if earnings come in bad and give bad guidance (or recession hints) we might start to see the VIX push back up leading into FOMC… but I think we might be in some pain sitting in this 400-420 area for the next few weeks until FOMC and CPI… Markets need a reason to sell off and to continue to sell off and they just have not had that reason yet… 0dte options has forever changed the game. DAILY TRADING LOG  Today I experimented with using 1dte SPX options again… if you have been following me for a while you knowing I used to love SPX 0dte scalps and level to level plays for all of 2022… however, come November when 0dte everday hit the markets the game changed forever… we were left with some extremely choppy and awful premiums… I had moved to further dte because we were having issues of entering and basically immediately being down 5-7%... getting stopped out and then seeing a huge move… it also was not entries and we were seeing premiums moving outside that of actual price action… Well I did experiment with some 1dte SPX today and so far I don’t hate it… I will continue to monitor this over the next week or so and see if I want to stick with 1dte or go back to 2dte SPY… The biggest thing I did notice today though was that mid day consolidation that the 1dte premiums got ate up extremely fast and often times led to being correct on the move and direction but finding ourselves losing value as the play moved in our direction."

Netlist is a legit company, some deem it a patent troll company, but this latest result from trial by jury with a unanimous jury verdict ALL in favor of Netlist, validating their patents involved and validated claims of willful infringement on them all by Samsung which allows for treble damages 2x - 3x the amount awarded by the jury. This is just the second domino to fall after Netlist forced SK Hynix's hand to settle almost 2 years ago today for a $40,000,000 one time royalty with over $600mill in licensing supply agreement to access certain portions of Netlist's IP portfolio. That settlement paved the way for Netlist to continue to lawful enforcement of its intellectual property by hiring the best litigation attorney there is by name of Jason Sheasby with Irell & Manella. He has a proven track record of substantial wins on many patent infringement cases. He will be able to add to his resume after receiving this unanimous jury verdict (issued this past Friday nearly 20 minutes before close, hence the spike) resulting in $303,000,000 in damages for just under 1.5 years of infringement on 5 Netlist patents AND this is EXCLUDING treble damages to be determined by the Judge in the coming week. What some people fail to understand is that Samsung no longer has a legal contract allowing them to sell Netlist product in which it is accounted for just under 80% of Samsung products. If Samsung wants to continue using this IP that they boastfully made over $3,000,000,000 (billion) in revenue from the same time period, they are REQUIRED to have a licensing agreement with Netlist. The jury proved this licensing agreement for just these 5 patents are worth upwards of $300 million per year. And there is MUCH MUCH more to this company than the 5 patents involved in that case. If you seek further information on the other ongoing cases against Google (yes the almighty Alphabet) and Micron, the largest semiconductor company in the US, feel feel to visit the r/NLST page to keep up with further information. There is so much free due diligence and many who have followed for years. This past Friday verdict was huge vindication for longs. GLTA."

Those who believed and held long own over 300k+ shares now with entries under 50 cents. I am not one of those, however my entry is in the $2.xx range.

444,20,HedgeAppleJoe,2023-04-23 03,,-1,I do have a question for you guys on Wall Street bets. Since you are the masters of the short squeeze. Netlist stock is unlike any stock I've ever seen with the way it trades. Granted it is on the OTC but they can have news that would send another OTC stock to the Moon and try to spike but get beat down quickly. The bid constantly being attacked. As of last week the guys who followed the short interest we're showing about 6 million shares shorted and none were returned at the end of the week. This was confirmed by some of the guys who shares are lent out of their account by their broker. They also confirmed none of their shares had been returned. Would this indicate naked shorting. In the scheme of things very little dilution the float hasn't really increased but I'm not an expert on these things so I'm kind of wondering what you all think of it? Since netlist is fighting monster-sized companies like Google and Samsung and micron I would imagine they'd be willing to pay a lot of money to keep the share price down? Just a thought I've had for a long time. The 303 million they just received and the patent portfolio they have with their pmic being in every ddr5 chip is a big deal the judge could increase that 303 million because of willfulness to three times the jury award and Samsung still has to take a license. The post trial stuff is not done yet so they can't file an appeal yet and netlist has other cases hanging over Samsung's head. They also have cases coming to fruition against micron and there is always Google when those are done. The Google case is in an advanced state of litigation so with all this going on I find it hard to believe on a week where there is a trial that the short sellers risk holding their position over the weekend? Seems really strange to me

448,20,Calm_Practice_4361,2023-04-23 02,,-1,Netlist is legit. They hold extremely important seminal patent 912 and just won Friday against Samsung. Expect the stock to most likely double or triple this week.
449,20,blumpkinspatch,2023-04-22 21,,-1,"As far as I can tell they hold patents for some important parts improving the speed and efficiency of server memory. Everyone uses the tech for free and so netlist is suing them all. Have been in court for approx 12 years and finally (Friday) seeing some positive results, after years of challenges to the validity of the patents. Should be able to monetize their inventions going forward. Expecting big payout I have 16k shares."
450,20,25cheeseburgers,2023-04-23 05,,-1,""" Everyone uses the tech for free and so netlist is suing them all"" is kind of misleading. Google has somehow indemnified a bunch of companies such as dell, lenovo etc due to this issue. Google actually stole the tech, from a meeting where they signed an NDA, were in talk for licensing/production.. then decided to steal it, because they could. and got third party to manufacture it. Samsung also admitted to stealing the tech from non-public information via JEDEC, Samsung broke trade agreements of supplying chips to google across borders where they had regional restrictions due to licensing. Hence the JDLA breach of contract, which was for $1 because netlist didnt care about the money at the time, only to sever ties and revoke licensing. Samsung has still been producing the tech since, without license. Samsung, was prompted by google to initiate the 912 IPR and somehow wormed their way out of proving google was not a real party of interest, once proven, was reversed At the end of the day, Samsung, and others, need this tech or risk falling behind the market, They will want to work on licensing straight away.

456,20,Finatic2,2023-04-23 05,,-1,"Being a Contract Law guy this ones fits the bill.  Nobody but Hynix actually has a contract.  Sammy did but tried to manipulate their ""JDLA"" and interpret it the way they wanted.  The problem is its a NY Contract not a Korean Contract that they can buy their way out of and manipulate.  They made a HUGE mistake.  They are on the record in emails about how they need the tech and how they wanted to drive netlist out of business.  They even gave it a code name....NEPTUNE!  They have breached every protocol of a Korean company or man for that matter.  Its a disgrace.  The key is again that it was a contract.  Spit and shake on it and have a witness and you have a contract.  They decided to not honor their part regardless of what they thought they could get away with.  And they no longer have that contract.  The other flip is any new contract does not have to abide by RAND because they ""breached"" a contract and have been found guilty TWICE.  Sammy needs a license and I can say if I were Chuck Hong I dont think I would give them one unless they paid dearly.  Hynix has a contract.  They paid and they also have a supply agreement with Netlist for 600 mil in product over the next 2-3 years since it has been 2 years in the works already(5 years total).  Why would I need Sammy?  Sammy needs me.  Sammy is gonna PAY.  Anyways besides that MU doesn't have a contract and has joined itself with Sammy so why would I give MU a contract?  Both will have to pay and pay bigly.  I think it gets personal in there somewhere but when you try to bankrupt a company to STEAL their patents you cross lines.  And when you JOIN that company in litigation you join yourself to the price.  MU is next and they are an American company.  They should know better.  They will pay the price.  Sammy got a year of penalty and its 300mil.  MU hasn't had a contract so it will cost them at least 7 TIMES as much for penalty and infringement.....with licensing going forward we are looking at approx 300 mil a year.  Yeah thats right.  Say it to yourself over and over.  HBM is the future for AI and Netlist hold the 060 and the 160 patent which is integral for stacked memory.  Next up is going back after Google.  Google has dodged a bullet but someone has to pay for Rank Multiplication and Google wouldn't be Google if it hadn't stolen the idea and the tech for search.  Imagine being back in the times of yahoo search.  Times will be tough for these companies but I can say 1 thing about Netlist.  Congratulatios!  Well Met Chuck Hong.  You hold the Keys to the Kingdom. Oh and I like the stock cause I own a bunch of it."

Once the CBDC is ignorantly accepted by the majority of people, I’d expect an Executive order to follow demanding all “assault” style firearms be surrendered and all those who don’t cooperate will have access to their funds removed. When confronted with the choice of feeding your family or keeping your firearm, I regrettably believe most will choose the former.  Not to mention it’s going to be near impossible for dissenters to drive to Washington to protest if you’ve got no money for gas.

506,26,LordBuggington,2023-04-22 21,4,-1,"Yeah I wanted a new raptor last year its either hand them 15k or I had one dealer I had bought from before who would let me order one at list but I would be at the back of the line and it would be at least 2 years before I ever got it. Ford makes some good stuff now, I bought 3 fords in a row, but everything cool is marked up now. Which brings us to the lightning, I like it and absolutely would buy one in theory, but the cost stopped me from ever even considering actually buying one. The cyber truck allegedly will be half the price and it is still cool to the right person. If I was ready for an electeic vehicle I personally would be leaning that way, but even as niche as it seems like it should be with the bold styling and all, the line will be out the door and I will be curious to see what they do sell for. All that said I made one of my few more sane financial decisions and I bought a honda civic instead of a truck I dont really need. Even those are hard to get the dealer by me had 3 civics on the lot. But a civic is 30k now so I cant really do a victory lap or anything, all I really accomplished was blowing 1/3 of the money I almost did."

Until then, everything you heard on the news media are either speculation, rumors, misinformation, or FUD. FRC is no META or FB, but FB is one of the most controversial companies in our time. During the Cambridge Analytical scandal, everything was thrown at Facebook . Hedge funds were selling , massive short positions , media blitz on Facebook business model and how it’s bad for users , FUD, analysts price cuts, users closing their account … I mean there was not single week that passed without negative news on Facebook. Fast forward, October 2022, Facebook was trading at $87. I mean can you believe a company that was a trillion dollars in market cap lost about 70% of its market cap and was trading at $87 ? At the same time, you had the media, analysts , CNBC , hedge  funds all questioning the business model , whether it could survive … even analyst cutting price targets, putting out notes that Facebook was uninvestable , adpocalypse , inflation , recession , tik Tok taking share from Facebook. I can go on every negative press printed on Facebook. You would have been scared to even buy because you would think Facebook will not survive . As of yesterdays close , Facebook is trading at $212. My point is when companies are facing crisis like what FRC is going through, it’s easy for everyone to throw in the towel. Media constantly speculating and sniffing for something negative to serve their  audience, analysts cutting prices and putting out scary research notes .  But sometimes, when you look at the company carefully , you will also realize not everything is bad . Most regional banks have reported, if it was very bad, you would have noticed it from the ER of regional banks. Remember how it was speculated that Schwab was the next bank to go because they were sitting on so much loses, and deposits were leaving the bank . Well they also reported , and it turns out that SCHWAB was unfairly targeted with FUD. Since then, anybody heard about Schwab going under , bank run on Schwab or any of the negative things that was spreading around Schwab ? PS: Bought Facebook at an average price of $89 Bought Schwab at an average price of $48 Amazon at average of 87 Google @ average of 85 FRC @average of $13. What is the common denominator with these companies ? At some point the financial media and bloggers , hedge funds and Analysts wouldn’t recommend touching them because they were going through some crisis"

First, there should be a diplomatic war; next, there should be a cold one, based upon economical sanctions.

Given that most production of what Americans consume is realized in China, and given that most of what China produces is bought by the USA and its allies, I am foreseeing a stallmate, a deadlock between these two countries. Let me put it differently: how would you think that the USA would go to war against China, given that all the condoms that Americans use are fabricated in China? Or phones, or laptops, or T-shirts. Nah, forget about it. And one more thing: do you remember all the idiots who, at the beginning at the war in Ukraine were rushing to buy Raytheon? On February 29, 2022, the price was 99.59.

655,41,NoobInvester018,2023-04-22,82,-1,"I'll try to answer each of the reasons you listed 1 by 1, and no I'm not going to be sourcing every answer, because I'm not writing for a research paper. You make the judgement if my answers sound reasonable or logical. For clarity I have a bit of a bias in agreeing with you on the lunacy, but I will try to use the middle ground perspective and remain as non-bias. 1.) The reasoning is simple, if bond yields are declining this would mean the cost of borrowing becomes cheaper. This would be technically bullish for tech companies that needed liquidity for their research/burning money or operations. Every extra 0.01% they can save means a lot for multi-million to billion operations. Now to address the second part of your question that bond market is a good indicator. The issue is that the bond market have been inverted for 12 months, and as such it has caused complacency and spurred the belief that this time is ""different"". Additionally, while inversion itself is a great predictor of potential recession it isn't the end all of indicator(s). There have been time where it inverted, but the depth of recession isn't always severe. So why does this matter? Because when the bond yield inverted initially last year, you saw the panic selling when bond yields inverted. However, 1 year later GDP is still positive, and the economy is still growing while not as fast, but not contracting. Overall, people think that this time is ""different"", and we have it under control or that this recession will not be as severe. 2.) The issue with inflation being sticky is that you have to look at what part of it is being defined sticky. From our perspective the fact that food/oil/finished goods keep going up in price means sticky. However, from the central banks/FED's perspective, core CPI is what would be categorized as sticky. Although core CPI have been well sustained, it is not as high as it had been. Thereby, working in the favour of the narrative that CPI in general is coming down/moderating. This helps spur the belief that we can cut rates by the end of year if Core CPI comes down enough. And markets are trying to get ahead of itself and pricing in. To address about the flaw with FED being able to sustain continuing rate hikes, as much as we want to believe the FED could. There is actually a true limit to how far the FED/government can hike rates. This sounds flawed and many will argue against me, but you have to remember the US is sitting on 31T and growing debt. Each year the treasury/government have to pay interest on that using tax payers money. While tax payers revenue can cover interest payments so far, for every rate hike increases, that means there is less that can go to the annual budget. And not trying to be political, but the current administration have ambitious plans and require more spending. Thereby, demanding more of the annual tax revenues to be allocated to afford said budget. This, makes it difficult for the treasury/FED to sustain long-term high rates before something breaks down in the system. Either you increase rates so high that you can't afford both interest payments and annual budget spending. Or you have to make budget cuts, and at the moment the current administration is not interested in that. 3.) You are absolutely right, in the fact that higher rates, means higher chance of problems for banks appearing. Unfortunately, as you can see from the recent actions of the Treasury Janet Yellen, they are willing to interfere and backstop/bailout banks. And from all of the hearings on capitol hill, Janet Yellen signalled supposed guarantees to all banks that they would be ""backstopped"" should the need arise. This of course is introducing moral hazard, however the markets are happy with the current answer and isn't pricing in potential threats. Rather, they are pricing in that in the event of more banking problems, this will in fact spur the FED to slow down rate hikes or pause to avoid systemic risks from appearing in the overall market. Making markets to be happy and pricing in pause/rate cuts at the end of the year, because deflation might occur as you pointed out. 4.) Exactly, as you said the FED is outlining recession, therefore markets are anticipating deflation will occur sometime in the later half of the year. The reasoning is that because the FED themselves have identified it, this will mean that they will pause/rate cut in the latter half of the year to soften recession problems. 5.) Debt ceiling issue is indeed one of the potential problems that might cause problems. However, there is this belief that the US will not default on its debt because every politician knows deep down the USD depends on it's credibility. Before, the US was on the Brent Wood's agreement. Therefore, the USD could hold the world reserve currency, and not fear a technical default as badly. Because the USD was backed by gold. Now it's only by faith/trust, therefore there is a huge political incentive for politicians to prevent a default. Right now Congress/President is just playing chicken and waiting to see whose right and whose wrong. Also there is the 2024 elections, there will be an agreement made and the treasury will just kick the deadline further down the road until said agreement is made. 6.) Your argument about commercial real estate is indeed true, but you have to remember for rate hikes, this is in regards to FED/government primary concern. They are not as concerned with the commercial real estate as opposed to residential real estate. Because there is a direct political fallout with citizens losing homes as opposed to investors losing money on investments. Therefore, this bubble bursting while devastating to pensions etc, the FED doesn't have to care as much for investors spillover. As it's dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability (mainly for citizens, not investors). Not trying to disregard it, but this commercial real estate bubble crisis have been going on for years. And each time they have kicked the can further down the road. Also there is the belief that interest rates will pause/cuts will occur later this year. Meaning that it is an opportunity rather than a real crisis (again the market sentiment is weird, but logical as it is forward looking). 7.) Ukraine war, directly impacts Europe more than the US. And to your point, while the Biden administration might be saying they're giving xx billion dollars aid packages to Ukraine. You have to see what kind of aid it is that they are giving, is it real cash or weapons/equipments/gears/food etc? If so the weapons/gears that the US is giving isn't brand new and are old or used equipment, but are being priced as retail new prices instead of fair value, which includes depreciation costs. It's a great way to look like you're being supportive with big number $, when in actuality, it's not a lot as the equipment, gears, weapons have depreciated a lot. Now this definitely affects the US budget, but remember giving away used gears that have been paid doesn't cost the current tax payers money. So it's contribution to inflation will be minimal and let's be honest, the US have billions of money to throw at reckless spending, a few more going to a more productive thing in the defence of democracy and shoring up allies who trade with the US will make them more dependent. Increasing trade in the long run, bringing in a net benefit. Making markets more happy for the future. 8.) To clarify, OPEC is not cutting off supply, it's reducing supply and while this will have a negative impact on the fight against inflation in the short term. This is starting to line up with the narrative of potential recession later this year. As demand declines in the face of a recession, the excess supply of oil will accelerate deflation to the point of recession or severe economic slowdown. The supply demand scales will reach equilibrium better if supply balances ahead of time to match demand. So markets are actually looking at this as another support for their argument of rate pause/rate cuts. And it's quite logical and make sense, that this is a indicator for the FED to consider a pause/rate cut should oil prices/demand come down as anticipated by OPEC. Remember the goal of the FED is to achieve disinflation back to 2%, not deflation. 9.) That's actually not true, the demand for housing is actually at all times high, it's the demand for mortgages is low. The amount of people that can afford current rates isn't a lot. This is what drives down mortgage numbers and if there is less demand, supply must follow. Thereby, helping the 10 yrs bond yield to be slightly lowered due to lack of demand for mortgages at banks/financial institutions. Now if mortgage rates come down, that actually spurs more house buyers to come in and buy. In addition even if what you said is true, with potential of a lot of supply coming to the markets. Then that actually feeds into the narrative to the FED about pausing rates/cutting rates. Remember I pointed out the dual mandate for the FED in response #6?  FED goal is Maximum employment and Price stability, now price stability doesn't mean affordable, it means stabilized/sustainable prices and not deflation. This means the FED is fine with high prices in housing as long as it's fundamentally logical. Which, sadly it is at this point as interest rates are too high and people who are locked into low rates aren't willing to move out. Thereby causing a lack of supply = higher sustained price = price stability. Horrible and inhumane from some perspective, but from market's that's good news! That's why D.R. Horton stock went up despite the abysmal earnings report. Hope of rate cuts/pause will spur more orders for new houses and lower rate will mean borrowing to build will become cheaper and spur more demand! 10.) Read my response to #6"
656,41,NoobInvester018,2023-04-22,38,-1,"Whew I'm really tired... Overall, markets aren't being hysterical to the potential pause/cuts of the FED. It's being perfectly logical, because like you said bond market is king. Now the FED's fund rate could be 5%, but over the span of 10 yrs the market is pricing in somewhere around 3.5%. Why? Because as I listed in this long argument there is a real limit to where the FED's can go with rate hikes because the 31T and growing debt interest payments will eventually outpace tax payers revenue should it go higher. So what does this mean? At some point the FED must pause or even cut rate hikes otherwise a default will happen. When that occurs the USD will devalue so markets are being logical and are going up in nominal value. Personal tin-foil theory: If your USD is becoming less valuable what will you do? Buy any class of assets that can generate a cashflow or returns that can match or keep up with the devaluation in the dollar. Therefore, market makers are going far ahead and buying equities/residential property/gold etc. This pushes up the value stock markets/real easte etc despite a hawkish FED. Because at the end of the day, the trust in the FED is over, and it doesn't matter what the FED do or if inflation runs away. The FED can't raise rates further otherwise defaults occur. It's why we have Zimbabwee, Turkey, Venezuela, Lebanon etc. Their currency has crashed, while for multiple factors at the end of the day they defaulted on foreign debt. Causing a currency crisis, that's why the FED can not raise rates up too far. And will have to pause at some point, the FED/treasury/government will not allow a default otherwise the USD will face a currency crisis too. Markets aren't dumb and they are pricing in said scenarios and just anticipating it ahead of everyone else. And at the end of the day they're not wrong the government will have to either pause or cut rates."

Really what it all boils down to minus all the doom and gloom worst case scenarios you think might happen is there is a recession coming and they can fuck right off saying oh it'll be just like after WW2 when we hit a recession and the market just ignored it.  That's beyond stupid and fails to even realize why the fuck it was ignored in the first place.  Because when you win a war that pretty much leveled every single other country on the planet that can even remotely compare to America, while you are left pretty much untouched and tasked with rebuilding half of Europe and Asia then theres alot to be bullish about.  Compare that to today and tell me what even is remotely similar of either scenario. Best case scenario the market trades flat the rest of the year, likelier case all we've seen priced in so far is a decade plus of free money environment getting quashed and everything got priced closer to reality.

Everyone loses confidence in the currency so they pour money into the stock market as at least the companies can somewhat offset inflation by raising price of goods. I do think we will see one more major drop, but the Feds will continue flooding the market with money as the debt death spiral progresses.

This allows them to control more of the supply chain controlling the costs of their product better than other companies. Owning their own dealerships cuts out a huge cost that other Auto companies lose margin on. Tsla is also a lot more than just a car company.

819,49,Fettiwapster,2023-04-22,,-1,My thoughts on why the vix is low because institutional cash positions are high. Funds  don’t have a need to buy as much insurance. .
820,49,Middle_Name-Danger,2023-04-22,,-1,I agree that there’s a lot of sideline money in cash and bonds and 30DTE options are not the preferred hedge right now. So the VIX is broken as a leading indicator. I also believe the VIX will spike during periods of actual volatility when options sellers appropriately price in volatility risk. So VIX futures and ETF/ETNs are a good speculative bet right now.

No one is putting on 28dte+?   Most bank PB reports I've read show that a good portion of ""smart money"" are still massively net short again after going neutral/slightly positive after that Jan face ripper rally. So actually, hedges would be to the upside.   Fundamental L/Os have been short a couple years now, systematics have flipped long since Feb because of the squeeze. Both crowds have been aggressively hedging to the upside."

Outside of equities I’ve been selling June-August puts in gold futures for when the debt ceiling drama plays out. That’s my favorite trade for 2023."

Sure a recession may hit us soon but i’s not here yet so the party goes on. Also the people that know when and how to hedge they are either out and banking on the high interest you can get risk free on the money market or place long term hedges that the VIX may not take into account yet…VIX only covers the 30 day frame.

1195,74,MasterBlaster4422,2023-04-21,9,-1,I’m a network engineer and Cisco is the biggest Router and switch provider out since forever. They are a core company that many other companies are copying like Aruba (HP) and Juniper. They also have solid certifications that people seek out a lot. Cisco is losing ground due to their expensive prices that they putting out. Seen a quote for let’s just say a Bugatti in GTA 5 for a branch wide device replacement. Literally just 22 ish devices while other companies like zoom for voice (phone system) are half of that. All in all a great company and I don’t see it ever going away. It’s more luxury now though and not used device-wise as it used too. The educational portion of it I don’t ever see going away. I will probably never put money on cisco or any other networking company due to how fast the technology is advancing in this field and how different vendors take the crown like Palo Alto is now with firewalls.

We are a huge enterprise and our CTO switched to Arista and Palo because Cisco was like you said a luxury. I personally like Cisco and have made good relationship with their SME’s who know their shit. Unfortunately the good ones get shifted around too often. Anyway, that’s my 2 cents."

1199,74,No-Dealer-4644,2023-04-21,3,-1,"They’ve started investing into data radios and other networking solutions for hard rock mining recently, as their market saturation in other applications is pretty thorough. They’re up against some stiff competition from entrenched existing manufacturers, but since a large quantity of the mines in my area already use Cisco for their static infrastructure like offices and warehouses, it’d be an easy sale for them to move into the mobile mining sphere by using streamlining of IT processes to sell their next gen data radio when it goes to production. I have to caveat this by saying I work for a Cat dealer in a region with several gold, silver, and copper mines, with several lithium projects opening in the next two years. I also work in Cat technology, so we’re already keeping an eye on Cisco ourselves as a potential change to the data network infrastructure we pitch to clients. After all, anything that streamlines networking for client IT teams is a win for us, as our technology relies heavily on the customer’s ability to build and maintain a solid network. I believe as a private investor that Cisco will grow in mining, adding to their existing market share. I am not a financial advisor or the like. Just a smooth brain, as they say ‘round these parts. But I’m starting to sink my own money into Cisco, since they have the capability to take on existing ruggedized radio manufacturers like Rajant and Motorola in the sandbox they’ve been relatively unchallenged in."

1233,76,SateliteDicPic,2023-04-21,1,-1,How would a second spike in inflation be bullish for stocks?  Many of the Fed’s hike’s have mostly likely worked into the system now and the economy picking up steam again along with higher fuel costs is going to be a problem for them.

For now, it's still negative 60 basis points, so unlikely. The banking episode/crisis/etc did in fact reduce the yield divergence from -90 or so to -50, but we're still in negative territory.

""The diffusion index for current general activity of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Manufacturing Survey dropped to -31.3 in April from -23.2 in March. This marked the lowest reading since May 2020 and was below the market expectation of -19.2. ""The employment index rose 10 points to a near-zero reading,"" the publication further read. ""The prices paid index declined for the second consecutive month, falling 15 points to 8.2. The current prices received index fell 11 points to -3.3, its third consecutive decline and first negative reading since May 2020."""" https://www.fxstreet.com/news/us-philadelphia-fed-manufacturing-index-drops-to-313-in-april-vs-192-expected-202304201235 Edited for more substance."

1243,76,danielhanchen,2023-04-21,1,-1,"Not exactly - I'm expecting the S&P will be range bound for sometime, until some marked deceleration. Sadly bears will have to wait longer - the US economy is like the Titanic. Some hits are fine. One small iceberg is fine. A few more is fine. But then a huge iceberg will come sometime this / next year, and stocks will do bad. Plus the report is refelctive of the economy, NOT stocks - ""The economy is NOT the stock market"". Ie - maybe earnings might still be bad? The report says INPUT prices are going up, yet OUTPUT prices are going up only for those who hiked - ie profit margin compression."

The western markets are finally getting franchise fatigue from over a decade of the same shit superhero movies and star wars we all pretended were actually good movies with a coherent plotline.  Well I suppose you could say oh they'll just go back to good old days of making original content again.  Which yeah maybe if you completely ignore just how ingrained studios are with tying their releases and financial success to the Chinese market.  And the Chinese market just loves to watch that shit.  What they don't love and the party isn't going to let past the censors are movies that actually make you think. So basically if they've got a good footprint in China then yeah I'd say it's a good investment.  If not well you are just going to be tied to the diminishing domestic box office and the fact between every tent pole release there isn't much to keep people returning to theaters.

1457,91,jackmans,2023-04-21,1,-1,"Well I believe the expectations are set prior to the results coming in. The companies publish their earnings forecasts using various justifications, investors use this information to inform their investment strategies. Then, the actual earnings come in and investors react accordingly. So if a company thinks things are going to be bad next quarter, they project low earnings and investors might sell their shares as a result. Then, actuals come in and are a bit higher than expected so investors buy back in and the stock price goes up. Said another way, the expectations of poor future results are priced into the companies share price, which is why better than expected earnings which are still historically poor can cause their stocks to rise."

1500,95,anygal,2023-04-21,,-1,"There is one little thing you forgot. The stock already fell over 90% in a couple of months. Sure, that doesn't necessarily mean much, it could be a tech company that have never ever made any money. But it is not one. If you look at it by any possible traditional metric then you will see that right now it is extremely undervalued. In my opinion there are two possible scenarios: First scenario: Everything is worse even than most people would think and they will eventually go bankrupt. We shouldn't rule out this possibility, but I think that the panic is starting to get over and since they haven't filed for bankruptcy yet, I doubt that they will. Second scenario: They already went through the worst, they remain solvent (though they needed help from others). If this is true, then depending on their lost customers etc the company should still probably worth 3-500% more than where it is right now if we look at their fundamentals. I like the odds, therefore I'm in."

1502,95,fartingmoney,2023-04-21,,-1,"I don't think we'll see a significant decline in earnings and see a decent, good earnings for Q1 2023. Bank run occurred towards the end of Q1 2023 so it'll be reflected in Q2 2023 earnings, which I'm guessing will see a significant decline. The big question is the bank's current deposit situation/outlook, what they'll do to replace the $30 Billion it received from various financial institutions and forward guidance. Think they have about 90 days left until the big institutions withdraw their deposits totaling $30 Billion. I'm bullish on the stock. If the bank were to go under, it would've already happened by now and I think at this point, government will not let it fail and do everything it can to keep the bank alive. I think they'll figure it out. Don't see anyone coming in to acquire the bank due to the big hole in their balance sheet. Really option is for the bank to remain as a stand alone and figure it out."
1503,95,Walk-like-a-woman,2023-04-21,,-1,"They have two options: replace deposits by borrowing new money (at a significantly higher cost than the deposits they lost because interest rates have gone up), or sell assets and realize existing large losses. Either option is significantly negative for earnings/equity. So you are correct in saying that the earnings outlook is dismal. It will take many years for the HTM assets and loans on their balance sheet to ( in theory) realize at par (that is, for losses - which are greater than tangible equity btw- to go away). In the meantime they are losing more by paying more to fund those assets than they earn on them. It’s not a good outlook.  Many other banks have unrealized losses but most of them have much better NIM prospects than FRC. Bank of America, for example, has more than 100bio in unrealized (MTM) losses. But they also had 95bio net revenue last year. They can earn their way out, their deposits are mostly insured and ‘stickier’ - so they get a ‘pass’ but it’s still pretty bad asset/liability management. FRC had unrealized losses 4x greater than 2022 net revenue. If FRC fails the FDIC will take the bank into receivership and guarantee all deposits a la SVB (not because they are actually all insured but because they are worried about financial stability and contagion). Stock holders would be wiped out, the banks assets would be sold (by FDIC) to recoup deposit guarantees, the losses on those assets would come out of the FDIC fund, and that fund would be replenished by a tax/levy on remaining banks."

1594,101,latending,2023-04-21,28,-1,"This is missing the bigger picture. NVDA massively over-ordered 5nm wafers failing to predict the end of the ETH mining boom, and is sitting on surplus inventory. However, their AI products are immensely more profitable than their products which serve the gaming market, thus orders to TSM can decrease whilst NVDA earnings still improve. I think they're horrifically overvalued, but the logic in the OP is deeply flawed."
1595,101,Garweft,2023-04-21,3,-1,"If AI is doing so great for them, why the mixed shelf offering a couple months back? Even they know their stock is massively overvalued, and took advantage of the situation."

1597,101,hogujak,2023-04-21,15,-1,"They don't do any sort of research. Inventory went up 98% over 5B worth. Basically all of the big tech companies are developing their own ai chips. Sure nvda is leading for now but companies like microsoft,apple, google will dominate ai market."
1598,101,ItsDijital,2023-04-21,7,-1,"Google's TPU is as good to markedly better than nvidia's a100s at various AI loads. I don't think the vast majority of people realize this. TPUs are also purpose built for transformer models (what all the xyz-GPT models are). If there is insane demand for AI compute, google will probably capitalize on their TPUs. I say probably because Sundar is a fucking idiot who keeps dropping the ball. But if they dump him or he wakes up, they do have an performance edge over Nvidia in AI compute right now."
1599,101,imposter22,2023-04-21,8,-1,Intel has some AI architecture baked into their new sapphire rapids chips already. Nothing fantastic but it brings some AI workloads to workstations. But they also have the Movidious chips too.
1600,101,4hometnumberonefan,2023-04-21,5,-1,"Any serious researcher uses Nvidia GPUs. Currently they have the most powerful GPUs, and you are correct in saying other companies are starting to develop custom chips. One side of the picture most people miss is the software side. CUDA is the base for many of the ML libraries as well as other optimization libraries. Unless Nvidia allows GPUs manufactured by other companies to be CUDA compatible, all non nvidia GPUs are at a serious disadvantage. Nvidia has built almost a apple like ecosystem that makes it difficult for AI researchers to switch to other companies. Google may come out with a faster, cheaper, more efficient chip, but that is not enough to overtake nvidia IMO."

1972,125,Puzzleheaded_Cut_735,2023-04-20,2,-1,"I have long positions in GDX, NEM and FCX. I agree with your thesis. Having said that, interest rate hikes means attempts to make dollar strong. So its on Fed for now. GDX may pop (about 5% or so) in near term from all the Miners reporting in the next couple of weeks. But for it to really run, we might need Fed to stop rate hikes."

1974,125,Typical-Mouse-4804,2023-04-21,2,-1,"Gold is not a currency. It’s worth more as an industrial component. Miners will not rip if the dollar tanks. They don’t mine the shit for money, they mine it for electronics."

1976,125,This_Environment_883,2023-04-20,2,-1,"Golds already ripped, most gold mines stock tend to suck as the use huge estimation but not ease of mining, and refining just oh the is over 100of ounces just here guys. Sounds great until you see the have no mining trucks the just did a few bore hole to pump a penny stock for fools …..hows that going for you amc boss man….silver mine 😂"
1977,125,NOT_MartinShkreli,2023-04-21,3,-1,GOLD breaking out like this on a multi year (decade) cup and handle just means it’s going to hit insane highs in the near future. If you’re soooo confident then short precious metals 🤡

1981,125,liteagilid,2023-04-21,1,-1,"I’m in one gold miner and one silver miner.  It’s about 4% of my account.  I’m not terribly enthusiastic bc ppl often sell these winners when they need bucks for other things in a recession. However, bc all the mega doomers see gold at 5k or whatever, having small exposure to precious metals seems prudent"
1982,125,Deep_Bit5618,2023-04-21,1,-1,One thing you are missing in your thesis is what you believe the market will do. For example: If the market tanks then the stock prices of the companies that make up GDX will drop even if Gold goes above $2100.
1983,125,Glad_Voice948,2023-04-21,1,-1,"Thanks for the response here. Your getting to the root of my real question. If there's a broad sell off and a weaker dollar, gold pushes above $2100, won't people pile into the miners and thus they'll find support? What you're saying is my big fear that a broad sell off, weaker dollar and higher gold won't necessarily be good for miners."
1984,125,Historical-Egg3243,2023-04-22 20,1,-1,"Makes sense. I dunno if the dollar will be weak, but I do think we're going to see high inflation for a very long time. Only downside is you're using options, which means your timing has to be very, very good. Amd you're buying when it's already up. You might get theta fucked on this one."

1997,127,Pepepopowa,2023-04-20,,-1,Well we sort of got the feds to back stop all deposits… probably helped.
1998,127,Jman24789,2023-04-20,,-1,"Yeah the alternative would have been awful probably a really smart play in the part of the fed.  80% of commercial mortgages are originated at these mid size regional banks.  If they collapse, the outcome would be devastation. It might be good for a bears portfolio, but not good for the country as a whole, so I think the fed played this one the right way."

GL! i did just for fun on my robinhood account. put a few grand on there and just said ok fck this, i'm just gonna trade off the RSI levels only.   some 0dtes and monthlies. the PDT set me back a bit but also made me think of better trades too. up 114% for the past week. i don't think it'll last since i'm playing with 0dtes and i'll prob get nuked one of these days but oh well, i find it fun lol i don't have PDT on my other brokerage, and it actually feels kinda cool to trade with pdt on another account because i feel like i have to spend far more time before entry since i won't be able to sell it the same day. hard to explain, don't mean to babble holy shit it also reminds me of when i was grinding like crazy before i had 25k. i loved that feeling of getting past that mark"

2333,148,NoobInvester018,2023-04-20,,-1,"Like everyone said here it can go both ways. The truth is, there's a lot more headwinds for going down in real value. But, in terms of nominal value SPY might can go up a bit or significantly, what do I mean by this? Simply put, USD could become weaker as such people move to risk on stocks and stock prices reflects for the weakness in the dollar. Things that could cause the USD to become weaker in the future are: Treasury bonds sells off by foreign nations or financial institutions, more debt spending, default (debt ceiling crisis) etc. As such when the dollar's value diminishes people want to preserve or move into assets that could help protect against the loss of value. And this often means people move into value stocks or even tech stocks (only under condition everyone believes FED stop rate hikes). And the SPY is rich of value stocks, so there might be an increase in SPY stock purchases, thereby pushing the value of SPY despite a lot of negative noise. A good example of this in recent time is like EU/UK stock markets. If you compare the currency of these nations/areas, you'll notice on a 5-years basis a lot of their currency have been devalued. Not significantly persey, yet their national stock indexes ie:Dax/FTSE/CAC, have been around the ATH region. While you could argue they might have positive headwinds, I'd argue the opposite, because a lot of these nations have a lot of fundamental financial issues or exterior threats Ie: War in Ukraine, UK 10%+ inflation, wage strikes, pension protests, fundamental inflation issues and others. So what can we draw from all this? Overall, SPY's real value may drop, when adjusting for inflation, but the nominal value might go up instead due to inflation. The FED have been signalling only 1 rate hike and even the fear of recession. So markets are going the opposite way because, markets are pricing in rate cuts and getting too excited.  Also, it's scary to think that we're still facing inflation well above 2%, and even if inflation comes down to 4-5% range you have to realize that this is on top of the 7-9% inflation we had last year. Yet, the dollar haven't really made enough headwind to make up for the inflation growth. So be wary of assuming SPY will just crash easily, it might correct, but it can easily go the opposite way upwards. Not because of any good news, but bad news and the fact that the dollar is weakening. TLDR: Flip a coin, could go both ways, but watch out and keep an eye on the USD. SPY can go down for fundamental or exterior causes/events, but can bounce back due to USD weakening. Just my 2cents I can be 100% wrong and my rationale is absolute regarded. I'm not paid to write this nor trying to push it for fun. Just my own opinion. Follow your heart mate! Cheers!"

Regards don’t understand central banks exist to manage foreign exchange reserves. Regards never understand that because the USD is used to settle 75% of foreign exchanges ($100 trillion per year) the United States central bank has a huge balance sheet. Does this mean the USD is overvalued and huge imbalances incurred are problematic? Sure.  But this this is a minor issue with some war thrown in. The US has already ratified major changes to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act. Soon, the UN will once again be managing foreign exchange. Kill Ron Paul"

Right now if you did not exit in Jan 2022 you are down an average of 21%. It will be more after capitulation. So let's say you exited in Jan 2022 w 100k. For easy math let's say the market fall 50% peak to trough. In Jan 2024 the market bottoms.  You go back in w your 100k. Your buddy who stayed in has 50k left of his 100k. He needs the market to double to get back to even. When he gets to even he has 100k and you have 200k.

Analysts estinate AMD's DC will rise even more this qtr(Could be AMD eating INTC's share or natural bew client aqusitions) and they estimate PC shipments will be down for quite sometime. So yea TSMC cutting PC Chips but not DC ones. Either ways, OP has done a good job and folks 'Correlating TSMC's numbers to AMD's chip production is wrong'. TSMC produces chips for many others including NVDA and Qualcomm as well. Chip Act blocks AMD's only 1 AI Card (which anyways is not sold much). I think 'Lisa already confirmed this last qtr'. Everyone knows AMD is not known for Graphics division.NVDA on other hand is impacted more by the Chips Act (DGX100 and H1000) were hotcakes for China but Chip Acts has been worrisome for them.

2641,172,FiefKief,2023-04-19,,-1,I have a hard time figuring out when resistance is actually broken. How high above the resistance line does a price have to go to confirm? Is large volume on the break needed? Does it need to close the day above the line? I traded a stock that broke resistance today and it came crashing down 20 minutes later and I was DUPED. Thanks!
2642,172,DaddyDersch,2023-04-20,,-1,it really depends on the time frame... so this is how i view it... my major support and resistance lines all come from daily and weekly... now this is where pattern vs. support and resistance differs... for strictly S/R if say my level is 4150 on the daily for futures... a wick is a hint.. but it is not a confirmed breakout of resistnace at 4150 until we see a candle body closed over it on the daily chart... now when we trade a pattern like this rising wedge on the daily... if we wick through that support then that is considered a confirmation of support breaking. i dont really care about volume when it comes to s/r  they are not dependent on that at all (for me at least). without seeing your stock the case could be that it broke through resistance and hard rejected by never closed... if thats the case then it is a great opp for a put play
2643,172,Big-Toe6215,2023-04-19,,-1,"One of the biggest benefits of SPX options is that there's no longer a fear of entering a trade in the second half of the day only to see your broker sell you out of it an hour before close.  For those of us poor people with accounts below an imposed algo limit, those last five to ten minutes can sometimes generate another turn to three of profit.  Unless you're jumping into SPX in the futures market, you have 6.5 hours to make the right decision.  A broker taking away  at least 15.4% of your time even though you're paying for all 6.5 hours and a commission (or PFOF or both) is robbery in my eyes."

But bearish divergence on the hourly and close to oversold on the daily with a bearish divergence yesterday. Vix also bouncing near a long trendline from earlier in the year.

Or, if you day trade SPY options, you can't offset gains of one contract with the losses from another contract. I'd greatly appreciate anyone's comment on this. Thanks! PS: SPY options are much more liquid, and much better spreads."
2649,172,Sbmagnolia,2023-04-20,,-1,Wash sale rule applies to options contracts. There is no explanation from IRS if difference in expiry and strike make the contracts different securities.

While I do think we are due for a near term dump, since markets don't go up in straight lines, it's time to face facts that we are in a new market regime. VIX hitting lower lows in the face of degenerating macro conditions is the same thing we saw during the COVID bull run, meanwhile all the bears were losing their ass shorting through that. Doesn't mean we'll have a massive 1 month rally that takes us back to ATH, since we don't have the fed printer to help. Instead a sideways chop biased to the upside. There's a high chance statistically that this bear market is over, and that downside is limited."
2657,172,DaddyDersch,2023-04-20,,-1,I dont disagree that we could be in more of a consolidation market versus bear... But i would disagree... i dont think this bear market is over... few things. We never even had a circuit breaker... its very rare to have a true bear market without one We havent made it through the pause We havent made it through rate cuts which both of those usually put the bottom in for markets I truly dont think inflation is peaked and that reaction could be big Also we are still facing a recession I dont know if we see a new 52w low without a black swan but i dont think we are gonna see 450s or 460s either.

You or anyone else shouldnt trade until u know solid risk and money management. I'll give a brief explanation, look on internet for more info. Risk/money management This decides how much your risk is gonna be vs your possible profits. Also called RR(risk/reward). For a starting trader I recommend 1% risk per trade maximum. And a possible gain of at least 2%. Wich gives u a rr of 2 to 1. For every dollar u can lose u can win 2 dollar. Making sure your trade only has to be good 33% of the time to break even. As you get more experience 2% vs 4% as opposed to 1% v 2% could be an option. More risk is something u should never do. If the problem isn't u didn't know but u can't do it cause u lack discipline.

Vix suppression is part of seasonality based on options contracts. March is volatile due to quarterly expiration on everything and then throw VIX in there. April usually bullish is because of the sudden VIX spikes around March expirations. This year, bank failure bullshit spiked the vix which everyone was buying calls. So, vix gets slapped down and pinned where dealers are positive delta. Starting 4/20, volatility can move freely again. This is a simple explanation of Vanna and Charm flow."

Retail regards (myself included) start buying back in.  Market recovers and the all clear signal is given. Meanwhile companies are playing the shell game of who can cover up losses the longest.  No one wants to be the first to fail.  Some too big to fail fucker will come out of the woodwork unexpectedly and get bailed out.  Then other companies will make a Fed bailout run and it's game time for the bears. I'm bullish through Q3 2023.  Puts can't print.  NVDA reaches ATH, gold dumps, slow grind up for the market.  0 DTEs get destroyed. Rug pull happens when crazy dumb bullish plays start paying off.

2917,188,melanthius,2023-04-19,23,-1,"EV batteries are generally higher energy density which is at a cost of worse cycle life. Most EVs do less than 1 full cycle per day which is glacially slow.  Since they go so slow you can squeeze more energy into the cells. If you start cycling them more frequently they degrade faster. Energy storage products generally have lower energy density, higher cycle life cells - they are able to move ions faster and have more electrolyte (which depletes over time) at a cost of squeezing less total energy in. A rough point of comparison is around 1000 cycles expected for EVs but thousands (3000-4000) are needed for energy storage products.  Most of the time you don’t use the same cell for both applications. So using EV cells for energy storage arbitrage and shit is analogous to driving many more miles per year which will kill your EV battery faster, unless it was designed to handle much more cycle life, which if it is, means you are getting a pack designed with less range. Tl;dr there’s always trade offs Source - I am highly regarded in the li ion / EV industry."

That is the time of peak usage and when they'd want you to send power back on the grid.  from 12-6am power costs 2.5 cents per kwh.  I could make approximately 11 dollars a day with a 60 kwh battery just by letting the power cycle back and forth.

I say this often with this data, it's not going to indicate motives all the time.

2951,190,Realistic-Plant3957,2023-04-19,2,-1,"tldr Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman participates in a conversation-style interview with Economic Club of Washington in Washington September 18, 2013. The New York-based bank said earnings fell 19% to $2.98 billion, or $1.70 a share, from a year earlier on declines in investment banking and trading. Higher costs helped hurt profit margins at the bank's wealth division and investment bank, analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo said in a research note. Equities trading revenue of $2.73 billion edged out the $2.65 billion estimate. ""In my view, we are not in a banking crisis, but we have had and may still have a crisis among some banks,"" Gorman said. "" I consider the condition not remotely comparable to 2008."""
2952,191,batlhuber,2023-04-19,4.1k,-1,That password crackdown is gonna work real wonders on their subscriber estimates. I can't wait...
2953,191,zjm555,2023-04-19,2.1k,-1,"Yeah it's definitely password sharing, not the fact that the streaming market is completely fragmented and oversaturated by competitors, and they continue to generate mostly shitty content."
2954,191,APestilentPyro,2023-04-19,66,-1,Yeah lmao im def not going to be paying for a new account. IF anything i will wait until a few shows are available binge them and then cancel but i dont even see myself doing that. I watch things with my wife typically and am hard pressed to watch something rather than play a video game in my free time
2955,191,epyonxero,2023-04-19,33,-1,This is the last move they have to boost subscribers in the US and Im doubtful it will work.
2956,191,bigfuzzydog,2023-04-19,17,-1,"Im probably gonna drop netflix when the password sharing hits. I mean I look at it this way, im currently paying for the ability to have 4 screens at the same time and 4k resolution. Me and my family all share the account. So 1 screen for me, 1 for my parents, and 1 for my brother and his wife. They want to crack down on my ability to do this. However there is no way for me to get 4k resolution without paying for the plan that allows for 4 screens. I dont want to pay for 4 screens if I cant let my family use the account without paying for another household making my subscription even more expensive. So what netflix is basically asking me to do is either keep my current plan that allows 4 screens but really im only ever using 1 and I get 4k or I could take on the additional charges for my brother and my parents houses which then means basically doubling my subscription cost, or I take the L and pay for a cheaper subscription tier, get less screens, and lower resolution streaming. None of these situations is good for me as a user. Lets also pile on top that the content of netflix has gone significantly downhill for a few years now and they think im not gonna just drop them all together? Keep dreaming. Maybe if they offered me an option for 1 screen, 4k, no ads for a cheaper price id stick around but even then the content is lacking and full of reality tv garbage so I still might unsubscribe"
2957,191,DarkSideMoon,2023-04-19,37,-1,"I’m an airline pilot, I travel all the time for work. Girlfriend uses a screen at home and I watch Netflix on the road all the time.

I already get paramount plus for free, Hulu is half off with my Amex, and I have prime video. I really don’t need Netflix anymore. This isn’t going to end the way they think it will."
2958,191,shaitanibaccha,2023-04-19,24,-1,"The only reason, I pay for highest tier plan is because of the number of people who use my account. They don’t have content to ask that kind of money. For $15 Max has the best catalog in the world. Going to cancel the day this is implemented."

3059,198,DYTTIGAF,2023-04-19,10,-1,"It's not the price. It's a simple fact. Tesla builds crappy cars. I  ride in them all the time. Hertz and Avis lease Tesla's to Uber drivers nationwide. I travel alot. So I get to experience the entire Tesla product line. A Tesla is like a golf cart (with a I Pad on the dashboard).  I have nothing against the car. I don't hate Elon. I could care less about its power source. It's a simple question of value. Tesla's are not special. The interior is pedestrian. It's driving experience is no different than a Toyota, or Ford product. The drawbacks are real. You have charging stations accessibility problems and cost issue's. Would you pay $40,000 for a car that has a 300 mile range (typically) and 1/20 the locations charging locations vs. gas stations? The juice is not worth the squeeze."

3076,199,Zak_Light,2023-04-19,40,-1,"Theta decay my man. The market moves however it wants to most of the time, and usually once you hear about some news that would affect stock movement with some concrete certainty, it already has with insider trading or you're just late to the party. The moment you buy an option, that thing is decaying like a raw chicken breast in the hot Alabama sun, so you better be willing to either sell it before it gets botulism or say goodbye to your money entirely. The vast majority of trades people here want to make with options are buying borderline worthless options far, far OTM for when their expiration is and hoping on a wish and a prayer that they'll get money. Newsflash kids, when the options are like .05 or less, that's because any respectable buyer knows they're worthless and they're being sold en masse by people holding the stock who want to just make a cheeky 5$ per 100 shares. Usually because, hey, if you've got 10,000 or 100,000 shares, that's enough capital generated from selling options that'll never exercise to buy a few more shares - and if they do exercise, sure, you'll be in big money, but so will they when you or whoever you sell it to exercises a call miles above the price at the time of selling in order to actually get value out of the option. And if, by some miracle, it does get very near but not quite? Well, your option will still be worthless if you wait til expiration, so you have to sell it early while there's still a chance there's money to be made and that it has some value. But for the people owning the stock that sold the option? They don't give a shit. It either exercises at 500+$, or it doesn't exercise but your stock still went up to like 498$, yippee for you. Most of these people sell it and forget it because they're holding onto it as a long term investment anyway, if it exercises for such a high amount they're happy cause they can just wait for the stock to go back down and reinvest, invest into something different, etc. Meanwhile you're hunched over your screen waiting to see when your option will have some value and be worth selling, and you're probably not gonna be willing to part with all the stress and attention involved for a measly 20-30% increase (you should actually, it's actually very good, but still), so you're gonna be waiting to see it go up more. But even if it goes up more, decay to expiration literally saps out value, so it could go up more but be worth less. Most people aren't thinking about the fact that the entire value of options is in the time to expiration (plus volatility, etc) when they're OTM, they just see ""oh it's gettin close baby, let's wait for it to get closer"" and inevitably they screw themselves by waiting. Keep in mind though that this chance is already very unlikely, because you're buying deep out of the money options. Consider deep OTM options like a very, very shitty casino bet. It's basically roulette wheel odds. You don't bet on 17 on roulette with your whole stack, if you really want to have fun you gotta dole it out and hope you hit"

3079,199,rydan,2023-04-19,5,-1,Back in 2007 I decided to start stock trading.  I was warned not to do options because you can lose money quick if you are new.  So I avoided them.  Lost $20k in my first year but I sort of learned how to trade.  Step away for years.  Wait until the recession blows over.  Makes a few hundred thousand trading and holding stocks over the next 5 - 6 years.  Finally decide to try options.  Bet correctly on stocks.  I literally bet the exact closing price months in advance.  Lose $8k of my $10k investment.  Somehow recovered back to $12k over 3 years.  Still have no idea what I'm doing with options.

I thought I got it fixed, but I still have no refund. I liked the convenience because I would have waited 2 hrs to pay a doctor $2,000 for just asking for an antibiotic.

3093,200,Fahcuetoo,2023-04-19,2,-1,"I can tell you with definite certainty that they DO NOT have a moat and are only getting their market share more eroded.  They’ve had layoff after layoff and their only hope is an acquisition by someone larger like Amazon or google who want to be in this market but can’t wait to build something.  The patient and provider experience on TDOC is poor at best and all the acquisitions they’ve made have created HUGE technical debt because none of them integrate with each other. It’s the equivalent of having a camera that won’t work with your monitor, so they have to be used independently. There’s virtually zero chance they get out of this down cycle and unless you’re holding on for a miracle, I’d get out at even. “Not financial advice” - standard disclaimer"

To my limited knowledge their acquisitions where well integrated in the company. I would like to watch/read more about this. Dept is a big issue, but they're cash flow positive, their numbers are growing (in general) and they're laying off the less necessary employees. Maybe dept is manageable in this case.

3101,200,slick2hold,2023-04-19,1,-1,"I use tdoc because it costs me nothing to see a doctor and is very useful to get a prescription instantly for minor issues.

Their support staff is utterly useless, imo. Items 2 and 3 were from 3yrs back when i last changed providers at work.  If I leave work or change again and they still require this BS process then I say tdoc is not going to grow."

3237,210,LionRoars87,2023-04-19,35,-1,"BOIL is basically UNG x2 guys. UNG is a fund that owns multiple forward nat gas futures contracts. It doesn't simulate the spot price of nat gas. If the longer dated contracts are priced higher than the short dated ones, the market will be in contango. When forward short dated contract rolls over to the next month, the fund must sell low and buy high to switch the next futures contract. So the price decays. I found this out when I owned UNG recently. The market is currently in contango. Go look at the May vs. June contract. BOIL has the same decay but x2! My advice is do not own either one but do what whatever you will."
3238,210,SailboatInCartagena,2023-04-19,26,-1,People should read this multiple times to learn what BOIL is. So many uneducated stupid comments here without any basic understanding on nat gas prices and what BOIL is.

If the market expects rates to drop along with the stock market, they’ll see capital appreciation on their bonds right when they want to buy up equities. Sure, you could make more money on short positions if you can time it, but maybe there’s low confidence on timing the start of a correction.

3292,214,Fightingforpars,2023-04-19,2,-1,Appreciate the SPX piece at the end. I tried playing SPX a few days ago and the premium movement made no sense and o was complaining about the no linearity of it. You explained it much better than I could . Honestly - it felt like even when the move went your way - and it surpassed - you needed a lot more movement to turn a profit. I appreciate theta decay - but beyond that drop - the same strike price shouldn’t yield much lower premiums.
3293,214,DaddyDersch,2023-04-19,3,-1,Yes so i scalped spx 0dte in 2022 like it was taking candy from a baby and then 0dte everyday changed the game forever... There were countless scalps that i had perfect entry but the premiums alot of the time seemed to preemptively pay out to the move... so day premiums spikes $1 then spy would move... there was so many times i watched spy move in my direction and losing value. I switched to further dte and had much better luck... Today i did see that happening at times too.. mostly in the mid day chop... entering and basically immediately being down 5%... gonna trial the 1dte the rest of the day. I had high success lately with 2dte but obviously if its worth it 1dte can pay much better.
3294,214,tits_up_trading,2023-04-19,2,-1,FRC has delayed their earnings to after market Monday the 24th. Do you think it could be a downside catalyst? They were supposed to report last Friday with other big banks but rescheduled. In my opinion if other banks are going to fail anytime soon bad earnings and guidance would have to be the catalyst. If the banks escape earnings season then it seems like smooth sailing for a while even if the Fed hikes a time or two more.
